The RACF development team has numerous tools that can assist you in managing your RACF environment. These tools include:

1. [BPXCHECK](http://ibm.biz/racf-bpxcheck): A REXX exec which uses the RACF IRRXUTIL REXX interface to report the status of various UNIX- related settings in RACF.  

2. [CDT2DYN](http://ibm.biz/racf-cdt2dyn): A REXX exec which examine the contents of the current classes in the RACF static class descriptor table and creates the commands to put those installation-defined classes into the ynamic CDT.

3. [CUTPWHIS](http://ibm.biz/racf-cutpwhis): A utility which trims the orphaned passwords created by decreasing the SETROPTS password history value.

3. [DB2PRM](http://ibm.biz/racf-db2prm): A REXX exec which converts your  RACF data set names table (ICHRDSNT) or RACF range table (ICHRRNG) into a RACF PARMLIB member. 

4. [DBSYNC](http://ibm.biz/racf-dbsync): REXX exec to find differences between two RACF databases and create commands to synchronize them. 

5. [ICHDEX01](http://ibm.biz/racf-ichdex01): A sample RACF ICHDEX01 which ensures that the default for the encryption of passwords is not MASKED.

6. [IRRHFSU](http://ibm.biz/racf-irrhfsu): A utility which unloads your z/OS UNIX System Services hierarchical file system data (HFZ, TFS, or z/FS) in a manner which is complimentary to the RACF Data Base Unload Utility (IRRDBU00). d
