<step name="Step1"><title>How to use this workflow</title><description>To use this workflow, note the following: <ul><li><b>Take ownership!</b>  Make sure that you have ownership of workflow steps that you want to perform, and assign other steps to the appropriate users, 
using the <b>Assignment and Ownership</b> action in the Workflow Steps table. 
Taking ownership is important, because without it you will not see the <b>Perform</b> tab, which contains the meat of the instructions for each step, 
instructions you'll need to complete the workflow task.. <p>If you're the owner of the workflow, you can take ownership of all steps. 
If you were assigned some or all steps by the owner, you can take ownership of those steps.</p><p>Do the following:
<ul><li>From the table listing the steps for the workflow (the Workflow Steps table), select the step or steps to be owned by you. This action is disabled if the step is not assigned to you. </li>
<li>Click <b>Actions</b>, then select <b>Assignment and Ownership</b> --> <b>Take Ownership</b>. The Take Ownership window is displayed. This page includes the Selected Steps table. 
You can expand this section to review the steps for which this action applies. </li>
<li>Optionally, enter a comment in the Comments field to document this action. </li>
<li>Click OK to complete the transfer of step ownership to yourself. </li>
<li><b>Did these instructions work?</b> To verify that these instructions worked, check to see if the <b>Perform</b> tab is not grayed out, and that when you click on it, you see 
information in the <b>Perform</b> tab. </li></ul>
</p></li><li><b>Expand all steps for ease of navigation:</b> You might find it easier to navigate through all the steps in the workflow if you expand the view so that all the sub-steps show as follows:
<ol>
<li>Click <b>Actions</b>, then select <b>Select All</b>.</li>
<li>Click <b>Actions</b>, then select <b>Expand</b>.</li></ol></li>
<li><b>Track your progress:</b> When you have performed the work of a step, click the <b>Finish</b> box below the instructions to track your progress through the workflow. 
This also takes you back out to the list of steps for the workflow so that you are ready to go on to the next one.
</li><li><b>Navigate substeps:</b> To navigate to the substeps contained within a step, click on the workflow title of the workflow at the top of the screen. 
Although the sub-steps are listed below the step, you cannot navigate to the sub-steps from within a step.<p>Note that a step containing substeps does not include a <b>Perform</b> tab.</p></li></ul></description><instructions>Congratulations! If you can read this, you have successfully taken ownership of this workflow step!</instructions><weight>1</weight></step><step name="Step2"><title>When to use this workflow</title><description>Use the procedure in this workflow when the coupling facility image must be reactivated, but the CPC on which the coupling facility resides will remain operational across the reactivation process.

currently active policy. You can create a new CFRM policy ahead of time to minimize net down time. Appropriate structure sizes for the new CFCC level can be obtained from either:
<ul><li>CFSizer, see <a href="http://www-947.ibm.com/systems/support/z/cfsizer/">http://www-947.ibm.com/systems/support/z/cfsizer/</a></li>
<li>Sizer, see <a href="http://www-947.ibm.com/systems/support/z/cfsizer/altsize.html">http://www-947.ibm.com/systems/support/z/cfsizer/altsize.html</a>.</li></ul>
<p>Updated structure sizes are necessary to ensure that a performance problem does not occur due to a structure space constraint. Also, the updated structure sizes will ensure that there is no 
issue restarting an application in
the future due to invalid structure sizes.</p><p>This step is required for CFCC Level changes. This step is
desirable if the sizes were not adjusted across the last
CFCC Level upgrade or if the usage of the structures has
changed significantly.</p><p>Alternatively, update the current policy "in place" to avoid
changing the name of the policy. For information on defining a CFRM policy, see <a href="https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSLTBW_2.2.0/com.ibm.zos.v2r2.ieaf100/subcfrm.htm">CFRM parameters for administrative data utility</a> (<a href="https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSLTBW_2.2.0/com.ibm.zos.v2r2.ieaf100/subcfrm.htm">https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSLTBW_2.2.0/com.ibm.zos.v2r2.ieaf100/subcfrm.htm</a>).</p><p>Caution: This procedure assumes that the CF links, control unit, and CFRM definition are not changing. 
If the links, control unit, or CFRM definition change, the CF may become accessible earlier than planned.</p><p>Note that if all systems reside on the same CPC then the new CFRM policy must be started before the
last system is shutdown.  </p></instructions><weight>1</weight></step>
