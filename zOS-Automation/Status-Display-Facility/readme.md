# Overview

The Status Display Facility (SDF) is a 3270-based real-time console that allows customer to monitor the operational status of any resource in their environment. Out of the box, SDF provides panels to visualize the operational status of IBM System Automation for z/OS objects, such as Started Tasks, Groups and messages. But SDF is also a very flexible component that allows customers to integrate other operational data as well. This makes it a tool that many of our customers like and use.

The information and sample code in this folder hopefully gives you a quick and pleasant jump start into SDF and inspires you to even add your own extensions to the component in future.
