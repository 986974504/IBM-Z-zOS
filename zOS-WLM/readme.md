z/OS Workload Manager
=====================

One of the strengths of the IBM Z platform and the z/OS operating system is the ability to run multiple workloads at the same time within one z/OS image or across multiple images. Such workloads have different, often competing completion and resource requirements. These requirements must be balanced in order to make the best use of the resources of an installation, maintain the highest possible throughput and achieve the best possible system responsiveness. The function that makes this possible is dynamic workload management, which is implemented in the Workload Management component of the z/OS operating system. 
 
With z/OS Workload Management (WLM), you define performance goals and assign a business importance to each goal. You define the goals for work in business terms, and the system decides how much resource, such as CPU or storage, should be given to it to meet the goal. Workload Management will constantly monitor the system and adapt processing to meet the goals.
