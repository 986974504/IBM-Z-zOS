 IBM z/OS z14 Workflow
=====================

**Helping you to prepare for the IBM z14 server!**

Did you know that you can use a z/OSMF workflow to prepare your z/OS system for migrating to the IBM z14 server?  
This workflow contains interactive steps for migration considerations, restrictions, and actions to take before you order your server, along with a checklist of items that will be discontinued on future servers. 
The workflow contains the same valuable information as the z/OS Migration book, in the topic "Migrate to an IBM z14 server."  You can provide feedback for each step in the Workflow, if you wish.
