		<description><![CDATA[  
			<h6>Description</h6>  
			<p>The IBM z13™ and IBM z13s 
				<sup>TM</sup> are the newest IBM z Systems™ servers, and are distinct from the earlier zEnterprise® and other servers. In this publication, these servers are referred to as the z13™ and the z13s 
				<sup>TM</sup>. z/OS® V2R2 running on the z13 or z13s sets the groundwork for digital business by providing the foundation you need to support demanding workloads, such as operational analytics and clouds, and your traditional mission-critical applications.
			</p>  
			<p>In a Parallel Sysplex® that includes a z13 or z13s with either a z/OS system running in at least one LPAR or at least one LPAR being used as a coupling facility (CF), you can include the following servers:</p>  
			<ul> 
				<li> 
					<p>z13 and z13s servers</p> 
				</li>  
				<li> 
					<p>zEC12 and zBC12 servers</p> 
				</li>  
				<li> 
					<p>zEnterprise servers (z196 or z114)</p> 
				</li> 
			</ul>  
			<p>The specific z13 and z13s functions, including base support, that are used by z/OS depend on the z/OS release. PTFs might be required for many of these functions. See 
				<a href="e0z3m11228.htm#z13bef21">Actions you can take before you order a z13 or z13s server</a> for information about finding the appropriate PTFs.

					<p>Migration to an IBM z13 or IBM z13s server has, as its base, a migration to the IBM zEnterprise EC12 or zEnterprise BC12 servers. This means that if you are migrating to a z13 or z13s server from a zEC12 or zBC12 server, and have performed the migration actions associated with the zEC12 or zBC12, you have fewer migration actions than if you were migrating from an earlier generation server and have not yet performed the migration actions associated with these servers. It is important to note that you can migrate directly to a z13 or z13s server without installing the intermediate servers, but you still need to ensure that any migration considerations are satisfied for the servers that you "skipped." To read about z196, z114, zEC12, and zBC12 server migration actions, see

				<title>Larger coupling facility structure sizes might be necessary.</title>  
				<description><![CDATA[  
					<p>When you change coupling facility control code (CFCC) levels, your coupling facility structure sizes might change. If, as part of your migration to a z13 server, you change CFCC levels, you might have larger structure sizes than you did previously. If your CFCC levels are identical, structure sizes are not expected to change when you migrate from a previous server to a newer generation server. In addition, similar to CF Level 17 and later, ensure that the CF LPAR has at least 512MB of storage. CFCC Levels 20 and 21, introduced on the z13 and 13s, support the Coupling Facility use of Large Memory to improve availability for larger CF cache structures and data sharing performance with larger DB2® Group Buffer Pools (GBP). This support removes inhibitors to using large CF cache structures, enabling use of Large Memory to appropriately scale to larger DB2 Local Buffer Pools (LBP) and Group Buffer Pools (GBP) in data sharing environments.</p>

						<a href="e0z3m11228.htm#z13__z13exploitation">Table 29</a> for a list of the z13 and z13s functions available in each z/OS release. Some functions have migration or exploitation considerations (see

If you plan to exploit new z13 or z13s functions, you can install the software and hardware in either order; that is, there is no requirement to install either software or hardware first to exploit a specific function. However, because of outage windows and testing considerations, you might want to consider installing all the software and PTFs required for the machine and the functions you plan to exploit first, then upgrade the hardware and, finally, update your customization to exploit the new functions.

				<title>z13 and z13s servers in a sysplex.</title>  
				<description><![CDATA[  
					<ul> 
						<li> 
							<p>A Parallel Sysplex that contains a z13 or z13s server either for a z/OS image or a CF image can only contain other z13 or z13s servers, or z196, z114, zEC12, or zBC12 servers.</p>  
							<p>If you are running z/OS on any servers earlier than a z196 or z114 server, you cannot add a z13 or z13s server to that sysplex; that is, you will not be able to perform rolling IPLs to introduce a z13 or z13s server if you have any of the earlier servers as z/OS images or coupling facility images in the sysplex.</p>  
							<p>The earlier servers in the sysplex must be upgraded to z196, z114, or later to have z13 or z13s servers supported in the sysplex. If you have any z/OS images or coupling facility images on an earlier server, and you intend to introduce a z13 or z13s server into that sysplex, you must migrate those images to a z196, z114, or later server before introducing the z13 or z13s server.</p>  
							<p>GRS supports the use of FICON CTCs for Ring configurations on z/OS V1R13 with a PTF and on z/OS Version 2. However, if you are currently using ESCON CTCs for GRS ring configurations within a sysplex, consider converting to GRS Star if possible, or using XCF signalling in a GRS ring configuration. XCF sysplex signalling is preferred instead of GRS CTC connections.</p> 
						</li>  
						<li> 
							<p>InterSystem Channel 3 (ISC-3) and Integrated Cluster Bus 4 (ICB-4) Coupling Links are not supported on z13 or z13s CPC. Instead, the IBM Integrated Coupling Adapter (ICA SR), introduced on the z13 and z13s, is a two-port, short distance coupling fanout that utilizes a new coupling channel type: CS5. The ICA SR can only be used for coupling connectivity between z13 or z13s servers, and the ICA SR can only connect to another ICA SR. IBM recommends that you order ICA SR (#0172) on the z13 processors used in a Parallel Sysplex to help ensure coupling compatibility with future processor generations. You can also use 12x InfiniBand coupling links, which are designed to replace Integrated Cluster Bus 4 (ICB-4), and to complement 1x InfiniBand and ISC-3 on a z13 or z13s server. InfiniBand coupling can provide significantly improved service times compared to ISC-3s for distances up to 150 meters. You can read about coupling links in 
								<em>IBM System z® Connectivity Handbook</em> (SG24-5444).
							</p> 
						</li>  
						<li> 
							<p>The z13 or z13s server cannot be connected to a Sysplex Timer (9037-002). The Server Time Protocol (STP) feature is the follow-on to the Sysplex Timer. STP is designed to allow multiple servers and coupling facilities to maintain time synchronization with each other without requiring a Sysplex Timer. STP is a hardware feature of the z13, z13s, zEC12, zBC12, z196, and z114. To implement STP, see the STP web site and the publications and other resources listed there. The STP web site is at 
								<a href="http://www.ibm.com/systems/z/advantages/pso/stp.html" target="_blank">http://www.ibm.com/systems/z/advantages/pso/stp.html</a> .
							</p>  
							<p>The STP design introduced a concept called Coordinated Timing Network (CTN). A CTN is a collection of servers and coupling facilities that are time-synchronized to a time value called Coordinated Server Time. A CTN can be configured in two ways:</p>  
							<ul> 
								<li> 
									<p>STP-only CTN, which does not require a Sysplex Timer. A z13 or z13s must participate in an STP-only CTN.</p> 
								</li>  
								<li> 
									<p>Mixed-CTN (External Time Reference and STP), which does require a Sysplex Timer. zEC12 and zBC12 were the last servers to support mixed-CTN. The z13 and z13s do not support connections to a Mixed-CTN. All servers in the network must be configured in STP-only mode. Consider migrating servers that require time synchronization, such as to support a base or Parallel Sysplex, to the Server Time Protocol (STP).</p>

							<p>IBM System z Application Assist Processor (zAAP). IBM continues to support running zAAP workloads on IBM System z Integrated Information Processors (zIIPs). IBM has removed the restriction preventing zAAP-eligible workloads from running on zIIPs when a zAAP is installed on the CEC. This was intended to help facilitate migration and testing of zAAP workloads on zIIPs. With a z13, one CP must be installed with the installation of any zIIPs or prior to the installation of any zIIPs. The total number of zIIPs purchased cannot exceed twice the number of CPs purchased. However, for upgrades from zEC12s with zAAPs, conversions from zAAPs may increase this ratio to 4:1.</p>

				<title>Install the necessary z/OS service, as indicated in PSP buckets.</title>  
				<description><![CDATA[  
					<p>You must obtain all of the appropriate Preventive Service Planning (PSP) buckets. In addition to the hardware PSP buckets, you must also obtain the software PSP buckets. Use the Fix Categories that are specified in the associated FIXCAT HOLDDATA to identify PTFs required for the z13 server, PTFs needed to exploit z13 capabilities, and PTFs recommended to fix known problems. Specifically, fixes in the following categories:</p>  
					<ul> 
						<li> 
							<p>For the z13:</p>  
							<ul> 
								<li>IBM.Device.Server.z13-2964.RequiredService</li>  
								<li>IBM.Device.Server.z13-2964.Exploitation</li>  
								<li>IBM.Device.Server.z13-2964.RecommendedService</li>

								<li>IBM.Device.Server.z13S-2965.RecommendedService</li> 
							</ul> 
						</li> 
					</ul>  
					<p>Fixes required for several zEnterprise functions (such as Parallel Sysplex InfiniBand Coupling Links, Server Time Protocol (STP), the Unified Resource Manager, High Performance FICON (zHPF), and zEnterprise Data Compression (zEDC) are not listed in the hardware PSP bucket, but can be found by using the following Fix Categories:</p>  
					<ul> 
						<li> 
							<p>For the z13:</p>  
							<ul> 
								<li>IBM.Device.Server.z13-2964.ParallelSysplexInfiniBandCoupling</li>  
								<li>IBM.Device.Server.z13-2964.ServerTimeProtocol</li>  
								<li>IBM.Device.Server.z13-2964.UnifiedResourceManager</li>  
								<li>IBM.Device.Server.z13-2964.zHighPerformanceFICON</li>  
								<li>IBM.Function.zEDC</li> 
							</ul> 
						</li>  
						<li> 
							<p>For the z13s:</p>  
							<ul> 
								<li>IBM.Device.Server.z13S-2965.ParallelSysplexInfiniBandCoupling</li>  
								<li>IBM.Device.Server.z13S-2965.ServerTimeProtocol</li>  
								<li>IBM.Device.Server.z13S-2965.UnifiedResourceManager</li>  
								<li>IBM.Device.Server.z13S-2965.zHighPerformanceFICON</li>  
								<li>IBM.Function.zEDC</li> 
							</ul> 
						</li> 
					</ul>  
					<p>Note that because the PTFs associated with these Fix Categories are not specific to a z13 server, you should consider specifying a generic wildcard for the server to ensure that you have all the appropriate service installed. For example:</p>  
					<ul> 
						<li>IBM.Device.Server.*.ParallelSysplexInfiniBandCoupling</li>  
						<li>IBM.Device.Server.*.ServerTimeProtocol</li>  
						<li>IBM.Device.Server.*.UnifiedResourceManager</li>  
						<li>IBM.Device.Server.*.zHighPerformanceFICON</li> 
					</ul>  
					<p>Similarly, fixes needed for zBX or to support the IBM DB2 Analytics Accelerator (IDAA) are not listed in the hardware PSP bucket, but can be found by using the following Fix Categories:</p>  
					<ul> 
						<li>IBM.Device.Server.zBX-2458</li>  
						<li>IBM.DB2.AnalyticsAccelerator.*</li> 
					</ul>  
					<p>If you are upgrading from a server generation prior to the zEC12 or zBC12 servers (such as a z196, z114, z10™ EC, z10 BC, z9® EC, or z9 BC), you must install all the maintenance and perform required migration actions for the servers that you are skipping. To read about z196, z114, zEC12, and zBC12 server migration actions, see 
						<a href="e0z3m11230.htm#mignext">Migrate to an IBM zEnterprise z196 or z114 server</a> and 
						<a href="e0z3m11229.htm#znext21">Migrate to an IBM zEnterprise EC12 server or IBM zEnterprise BC12 server</a>.
					</p>  
					<p>If you are exploiting z13 capabilities by installing a web deliverable, you must install the PTFs listed in the software PSP buckets for each of the web deliverables that you are installing. See the Program Directory associated with the web deliverable to identify the required software PSP buckets.</p>  
					<p>The REPORT MISSINGFIX command checks your GLOBAL zone for FIXCAT HOLDDATA matching the FIXCAT values specified on the command. The command then compares the APARs identified in that FIXCAT HOLDDATA with the PTFs installed in the specified zones, and produces a report to identify any APARs not resolved. In other words, it reports which PTFs (fixes) are missing for the specified fix categories. Furthermore, the command produces a customized job used to obtain any PTFs not already RECEIVEd via the RECEIVE ORDER command, and install any missing service via the APPLY CHECK command.</p>  
					<p>Note the FIXCAT operand on the REPORT MISSINGFIX command can list multiple fix categories, as well as using the same wildcarding techniques described in this topic for the SOURCEID operand. Because both of these techniques are simple and integrated into basic SMP/E commands, use them periodically to ensure the latest PTFs specified in the hardware and software PSP buckets are installed (since PSP buckets can be updated daily). SMP/E also provides an Explorer function which helps in identifying new fix categories which may be of interest. See the IBM fix category Values and Descriptions page for a description of all the fix categories: 
						<a href="http://www.ibm.com/systems/z/os/zos/features/smpe/fix-category.html">http://www.ibm.com/systems/z/os/zos/features/smpe/fix-category.html</a>. For complete information about the REPORT MISSINGFIX command, see

				<title>Prepare for the new machine instruction mnemonics.</title>  
				<description><![CDATA[  
					<p>In support of the z13 server, there are new machine instructions. The new machine instructions (mnemonics) may collide with (be identical to) the names of Assembler macro instructions you use. In the event of such collisions, the Assembler’s default opcode table (UNI) will treat specification of these names as instructions when the z13 required service is installed, probably causing Assembler error messages and possibly causing generation of incorrect object code. If you write programs in Assembler Language, compare the names of Assembler macro instructions used to the new machine instructions (documented in the latest 
						<cite>z/Architecture Principles of Operation</cite>, SA22-7832) to identify any such conflicts or collisions that would occur. Identical names will cause Assembler errors or the generation of incorrect object code when you assemble your programs. For a tool to help in identifying mnemonic conflicts, see 
						<cite>Techdoc PRS5289</cite> at the 
						<a href="http://www-03.ibm.com/support/techdocs/atsmastr.nsf/WebIndex/PRS5289">IBM Techdocs website</a>.
					</p>  
					<p>If a conflict is identified, take one of these actions:</p>  
					<ul> 
						<li> 
							<p>Change the name of your macro instruction.</p> 
						</li>  
						<li> 
							<p>Specify PARM=’...OPTABLE(YOP)...’ (or some other earlier opcode table).</p> 
						</li>  
						<li> 
							<p>Specify a separate ASMAOPT file containing assembler options such as in the previous method (this method requires no changes to source code or JCL).</p> 
						</li>  
						<li> 
							<p>Add as the first statement of your source program: *PROCESS OPTABLE(YOP) (or some other earlier opcode table).</p> 
						</li>  
						<li> 
							<p>Specify the PROFILE option either in JCL or the ASMAOPT file, and the specified or default member of the SYSLIB data set is copied into the front of the source program.</p> 
						</li>  
						<li> 
							<p>If you must use both a new instruction and a macro with the same name in an assembly you can use a coding technique that permits both use of a new instruction and a macro with the same name in an assembly such as HLASM mnemonic tags (:MAC :ASM).</p>

					<p>FICON Express16S supports a link data rate of 16 gigabits per second (GBPS) and auto-negotiation to 4 or 8 GBPS for synergy with existing switches, directors, and storage devices. With support for native FICON, High Performance FICON for System z (zHPF), and Fibre Channel Protocol (FCP), the new FICON Express16S channel is designed to work with your existing fiber optic cabling environment. The FICON Express16S feature running at end-to-end 16 GBPS link speeds provides reduced latency for large read/write operations, and increased bandwidth compared to the FICON Express8S feature.</p>

				<description><![CDATA[  
					<p>The IBM z Systems servers have improved the channel subsystem (CSS) scalability, as follows:</p>  
					<ul> 
						<li> 
							<p>The z13 server improves CSS scalability with support for six logical channel subsystems (LCSSs), which are required to support the 85 LPARs for z13, four subchannel sets (to support more devices per logical channel subsystem), and 32K devices per FICON channel, up from 24K channels in the previous generation. Additionally, a fourth subchannel set for each LCSS is provided to facilitate elimination of single points of failure for storage after a disk failure.</p> 
						</li>  
						<li> 
							<p>The z13s server improves CSS scalability with support for three logical channel subsystems (LCSSs) which are required to support the 40 LPARs for IBM z13s, three subchannel sets (to support more devices per logical channel subsystem), and 32K devices per FICON channel up from 24K channels in the previous generation. Additionally, a third subchannel set for each logical channel subsystem (LCSS) is provided to facilitate elimination of single points of failure for disk storage devices.</p>

				<title>PCIe and HCD Definitions.</title>  
				<description><![CDATA[  
					<p>z/OS V2R1, and z/OS V2R1 HCD (FMID HCS7790) support full exploitation for z13 and z13s processors ( types 2964 and 2965) with support for up to 6 channel subsystems and 4 subchannel sets. To support PCIe functions for systems that are running on zEC12, zBC12, z13, or z13s servers, HCD introduced a new dialog for defining PCIe functions and assigning the functions to LPARs.</p>  
					<p>z/OS V1R13 HCD (HCS7780) supports limited exploitation for z13 and z13s servers ( types 2964 and 2965). For PCIE functions, it is possible to define complete types 2964 and 2965 servers, including PCIe functions and the new channel types and capabilities. However, a processor configuration can be dynamically changed or activated only if it contains neither PCIe function nor a PNETID attribute. For a software activation with hardware validation, PCIe functions and the PNETID attribute are ignored.</p>  
					<p>IBM recommends that you define and activate all the new hardware definitions on a z/OS V2R2 system, or on a V2R1 system with the appropriate HCD PTF (APAR OA44294) installed and perform software activations (with hardware validation) only on lower-level systems.</p>

				<title>Consider the changes in the CPU Measurement Facility counters.</title>  
				<description><![CDATA[  
					<p>The number of CPU measurement facility counters for z13 and z13s servers remains at 128. Though the structure of the SMF 113 record does not change, the values, interpretations, and frequency of certain sections do change; therefore, current tools that use the data must be updated for the z13 and z13s servers.</p>  
					<p>For example, consider the following SMF record field:</p>  
					<ul> 
						<li> 
							<p>SMF113_2_CtrVN2 identifies how to interpret the MT-Diagnostic, Crypto, and Extended Counter Sets. As described in 
								<cite>The IBM CPU Measurement Facility Extended Counters Definition for z10 and z196</cite>, SA23-2260, this field is set to 1 (for z10), 2 (for z196 or z114), 3 (for zEC12 and zBC12), or 4 (for z13 and z13s).
							</p> 
						</li> 
					</ul> Note: As of z/OS V2R1, if you use the CPU Measurement Facility, IBM recommends that your installation collect SMF 113 subtype 1 and 2 records. IBM also recommends that products process SMF 113 subtype 1 records when available because that is where future enhancements will be made. If subtype 1 records are not available, products can process subtype 2 records.
