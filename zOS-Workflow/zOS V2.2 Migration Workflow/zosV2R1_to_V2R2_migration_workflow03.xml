			<title>Typical migration steps</title>  
			<description><![CDATA[  
				<p>It is possible to make migration changes at the same time you make the changes necessary to exploit new functions in the new release. However, the more prudent approach is to do your migration first and then exploit new functions. The typical steps to accomplish this are:</p>  
				<ol> 
					<li> 
						<p>Learn about z/OS V2R2. Good sources of information include:</p>  
						<ul> 
							<li> 
								<cite>z/OS Introduction and Release Guide</cite> 
							</li>  
							<li> 
								<cite>z/OS Planning for Installation</cite> 
							</li>  
							<li> 
								<p>The z/OS Library at 
									<a href="http://www.ibm.com/systems/z/os/zos/bkserv/" target="_blank">z/OS Internet Library (http://www.ibm.com/systems/z/os/zos/bkserv/)</a>.
								</p> 
							</li> 
						</ul> 
					</li>  
					<li> 
						<p>Perform as many of the migration actions as you can on your existing ("old") system so that you have fewer actions to perform after you install z/OS V2R2. In this information, the actions you can perform on your existing system are identified by headings that say 
							<strong>Actions to perform before installing z/OS V2R2</strong>. (Note that not all of the actions are required. Some depend on your environment, configuration, and workload, and are identified accordingly.) These actions should be made to, or copied (cloned) to, all existing systems that will be migrated to z/OS V2R2.
						</p>  
						<p>Use IBM Health Checker for z/OS to assist with some migration actions. See 
							<a href="#mighlch">Using IBM Health Checker for z/OS for migration checking</a>.
						</p> 
					</li>  
					<li> 
						<p>Order and install coexistence and fallback service for any system that will share resources with a z/OS V2R2 system. (See 
							<a href="#coxptfs">Install coexistence and fallback PTFs</a>.) This service needs to be installed on all systems that will coexist with z/OS V2R1 and all systems that will be migrated to z/OS V2R2 (and which you might fall back to).
						</p> 
					</li>  
					<li> 
						<p>Prepare the driving system. For driving system requirements, see the topic about preparing the driving system in 
							<cite>z/OS Planning for Installation</cite>.
						</p> 
					</li>  
					<li> 
						<p>Order and install z/OS V2R2. If you use a ServerPac, refer to 
							<cite>ServerPac: Installing Your Order</cite>. If you use a CBPDO, see the 
							<cite>z/OS Program Directory</cite> at the 
							<a href="http://www-03.ibm.com/systems/z/os/zos/installation/" target="_blank">z/OS installation related information website</a>.
						</p> 
					</li>  
					<li> 
						<p>Prepare target system hardware and software. During this step, perform the migration actions identified by headings that say 
							<strong>actions to perform before the first IPL of z/OS V2R2</strong>. (Again, not all of the actions are required. Some depend on your environment, configuration, and workload, and are identified accordingly.)
						</p> 
					</li>  
					<li> 
						<p>IPL the new z/OS V2R2 system with your updated customization and configuration files.</p> 
					</li>  
					<li> 
						<p>Perform any migration actions identified by headings that say 
							<strong>actions to perform after the first IPL of z/OS V2R2</strong>. (Again, not all of the actions are required. Some depend on your environment, configuration, and workload, and are identified accordingly.)
						</p>  
						<p>Use IBM Health Checker for z/OS to assist with some migration actions. See 
							<a href="#mighlch">Using IBM Health Checker for z/OS for migration checking</a>.
						</p> 
					</li>  
					<li> 
						<p>Deploy z/OS V2R2 to other systems within a sysplex, data center, and enterprise.</p>  
						<p> 
							<strong>The migration is now complete</strong>.
						</p> 
					</li>  
					<li> 
						<p>When you are confident that a system, or in some cases all systems in a sysplex, are not going to fall back to z/OS V2R1 or z/OS V1R13 exploit the functions introduced in z/OS V2R2.</p> 
					</li>  
					<li> 
						<p>Deploy this exploitation on other systems (again within a sysplex, data center, and eventually enterprise).</p> 
					</li> 
				</ol>

			<title>Using IBM Health Checker for z/OS for migration checking</title>  
			<description><![CDATA[  
				<p>Before you migrate to a new z/OS release, you can use IBM Health Checker for z/OS to assist with migration planning. Migration checks can help you determine the applicability of various migration actions to your current system. As with other checks provided by IBM Health Checker for z/OS, no updates are made to the system. Migration checks report only on the applicability of specific migration actions on a system, and only on the currently active system.</p> Note: As of z/OS V2R1, the IBM Health Checker for z/OS is started automatically at initialization. For more information, see 
				<a href="#maxusers">Accommodate new address spaces</a> and 
				<a href="#hcsetup">Convert your existing IBM Health Checker for z/OS setup for automatic start-up</a>. 
				<p>Migration checks are similar to the other checks provided by IBM Health Checker for z/OS. The only differences are:</p>  
				<ul> 
					<li> 
						<p>Migration checks are inactive by default.</p> 
					</li>  
					<li> 
						<p>The names of migration checks begin with the characters 
							<strong>ZOSMIG</strong>. Following this prefix is a value to help you plan the timing of the migration action, as follows:
						</p>  
						<dl> 
							<dt>ZOSMIGVvRr_NEXT</dt>  
							<dd> 
								<p>Migration action is recommended, but will become a required migration action in the release after V vR 
									<em>r</em>.
								</p> 
							</dd>  
							<dt>ZOSMIGVvRr_NEXT2</dt>  
							<dd> 
								<p>Migration action is recommended, but will become a required migration action two releases after V vR 
									<em>r</em>.
								</p> 
							</dd>  
							<dt>ZOSMIGVvRr</dt>  
							<dd> 
								<p>Migration action is required in the release indicated by V vR 
									<em>r</em>.
								</p> 
							</dd>  
							<dt>ZOSMIGREC</dt>  
							<dd> 
								<p>Migration action is recommended for the foreseeable future. The migration action might never be required.</p> 
							</dd>  
							<dt>ZOSMIGREQ</dt>  
							<dd> 
								<p>Migration action that is recommended now, but will be required in a future release.</p> 
							</dd> 
						</dl> Note: In previous releases, the names of migration checks followed a different set of naming conventions: one for ICSF, which used the convention 
						<strong>ICSFMIG nnnn_component_program_name</strong>, and one for the rest of z/OS, which used the convention 
						<strong>ZOSMIGV vv R rr_component_program_name</strong>.
					</li> 
				</ul>  
				<p>On your current z/OS release, follow these steps:</p>  
				<ol> 
					<li> 
						<p>Install the latest migration checks. Review all the latest health checks for both best practices and migration by using the SMP/E FIXCAT IBM.Function.HealthChecker.</p>  
						<p>You might want to install the PTFs during a regular service window, so that an IPL is scheduled afterward. Checks are often added by a function when it is started or restarted, so you might find that installing the PTFs before a scheduled IPL works best for you. More migration checks can be added at different times, so having all the latest checks installed before making your migration plans is recommended.</p> 
					</li>  
					<li> 
						<p>Activate the migration checks that are appropriate to your migration path. Because the naming convention for migration checks indicates which release introduced the corresponding migration actions, you can activate only the checks that are appropriate for your migration path. Using SDSF (or another method for viewing checks, such as filters), you can view ahead of time which migration checks you have available on your system. For example, if you are migrating from z/OS V1R13 to z/OS V2R2, you must activate the migration checks for changes that occurred in both z/OS V2R1 and z/OS V2R2. If you are migrating from z/OS V2R1 to z/OS V2R2, you need to activate only the migration checks for changes that occurred in z/OS V2R2. There are many ways to make a check active, and many ways to use wildcards to include specific checks.</p>  
						<p>Here are some examples of using the MODIFY command to make checks active:</p>  
						<ul> 
							<li>F HZSPROC,ACTIVATE,CHECK=(IBM*,*MIG*)</li>  
							<li>F HZSPROC,ACTIVATE,CHECK=(IBM*,ICSFMIG*)</li>  
							<li>F HZSPROC,ACTIVATE,CHECK=(IBM*,ZOSMIG*)</li> 
						</ul> 
					</li>  
					<li> 
						<p>Review the migration check output and rerun checks. Any exceptions should be addressed in your migration plan. If you can complete the migration action before you move to the new z/OS release, you can rerun the check to verify that it was completed correctly on your current system. In some cases, the check might be available for running on the new z/OS release for verification after that release is IPLed.</p> 
					</li>  
					<li> 
						<p>Deactivate the migration checks if you want. If you no longer desire to have the migration checks active, you can deactivate them similar to the way you activated them. For example:</p>  
						<ul> 
							<li>F HZSPROC,DEACTIVATE,CHECK=(IBM*,*MIG*)</li>  
							<li>F HZSPROC,DEACTIVATE,CHECK=(IBM*,ICSFMIG*)</li>  
							<li>F HZSPROC,DEACTIVATE,CHECK=(IBM*,ZOSMIG*)</li> 
						</ul> 
					</li> 
				</ol>  
				<p>Within this document, the migration actions that have checks are clearly identified within the migration actions.</p>  
				<p>Not all migration actions in this document are addressed by checks; many migration actions do not lend themselves to programmatic checking. Therefore, use this document to prepare your migration plan and do not rely on checks only.</p>

				<title>System REXX considerations</title>  
				<description><![CDATA[  
					<p>Several IBM Health Checker for z/OS migration health checks are written in compiled System REXX. These health checks rely on System REXX customization and runtime activities being completed. If System REXX and the security environment that System REXX requires has not been properly customized, the System REXX health checks will not run successfully. Also, the compiled REXX execs must have the proper runtime support from the Alternate Library for REXX (available in z/OS since V1R9) or from IBM Library for REXX on zSeries (5695-014).</p> Note: To allow System REXX to use JES services, the AXRnn address spaces are started under the primary subsystem. Therefore, you must end the AXRnn address spaces before you shut down JES2. You do not have to stop the AXR address space; this action only affects the secondary AXRnn address spaces. 
					<p>More information is available in the following references:</p>  
					<ul> 
						<li> 
							<p>For information about System REXX customization, see the topic on System REXX in 
								<cite>z/OS MVS Programming: Authorized Assembler Services Guide</cite>.
							</p> 
						</li>  
						<li> 
							<p>For compiled REXX exec runtime availability, see "Alternate Library for REXX Customization Considerations" in the

							<li> 
								<p>Identify which PSP buckets to review. For this task you will need to know:</p>  
								<ul> 
									<li> 
										<p>PSP bucket upgrade IDs (or "upgrades"). The most relevant upgrades are those related to z/OS V2R2 and its servers. The z/OS V2R2 upgrade is ZOSV2R2; the server upgrades are shown in 
											<a href="#pspbuck__psptable">Table 2</a>.
										</p> 
									</li>  
									<li> 
										<p>FIXCAT values if you use the SMP/E REPORT MISSINGFIX command in conjunction with the FIXCAT type of HOLDDATA (as mentioned in the tip that follows). The FIXCAT values are shown in 
											<a href="#pspbuck__psptable">Table 2</a>.
										</p> Note: 
										<ul> 
											<li> 
												<p>The values shown are for the minimum support necessary for the servers. If you exploit additional functions on a server, the FIXCAT value will have additional qualifiers.</p> 
											</li>  
											<li> 
												<p>You must run z/OS V2R2 on a z10 EC or z10 BC or later. See

						<h5 id="wq46">Description</h5>  
						<p>By installing coexistence and fallback PTFs on your pre-z/OS V2R2 systems, you allow the systems to coexist with z/OS V2R2 systems during your migration. Installing coexistence and fallback PTFs also allows for fallback to the previous systems, if necessary. Coexistence and fallback are important because they allow you to migrate systems in a multisystem configuration to z/OS V2R2 using rolling IPLs (one system at a time), allowing for continuous application availability.</p>

						<p>Before you introduce z/OS V2R2 into your environment, install coexistence and fallback PTFs on all pre-z/OS V2R2 systems with which your z/OS V2R2 system will coexist.</p>  
						<p>Use the SMP/E REPORT MISSINGFIX command with the FIXCAT type of HOLDDATA as follows:</p>  
						<ol> 
							<li> 
								<p>Obtain and RECEIVE the latest HOLDDATA onto your pre-z/OS V2R2 systems. Use your normal service acquisition portals or download the HOLDDATA directly from 
									<a href="http://service.software.ibm.com/holdata/390holddata.html" target="_blank">http://service.software.ibm.com/holdata/390holddata.html</a>. Select Full from the Download NOW column to receive the FIXCAT HOLDDATA; the other files do not contain FIXCATs.
								</p> 
							</li>  
							<li> 
								<p>Run the SMP/E REPORT MISSINGFIX command on your pre-z/OS V2R2 systems and specify a Fix Category (FIXCAT) value of "IBM.Coexistence.z/OS.V2R2". The report identifies the missing coexistence and fallback PTFs for that system. For more information about the REPORT MISSINGFIX command, see 
									<cite>SMP/E for z/OS Commands</cite>.
								</p> 
							</li>  
							<li> 
								<p>Periodically, you might want to obtain the latest HOLDDATA and rerun the REPORT MISSINGFIX command to find out whether there are any new coexistence and fallback PTFs.</p>

							<p>To keep the z/OS root file system in a single data set, do one of the following:</p>  
							<ul> 
								<li> 
									<p>Move your z/OS root file system to a larger DASD volume geometry</p> 
								</li>  
								<li> 
									<p>Use multiple volumes for the z/OS root file system data set.</p> 
								</li> 
							</ul>  
							<p>If your z/OS root data set cannot fit on the volume or volumes you have defined for it, divide the z/OS root, with the smaller file systems being managed together.</p>  
							<p>Remember that all systems to which you deploy the z/OS root file system need sufficient DASD space to hold the z/OS root.</p> Tip: File systems for subsystems and products other than the z/OS product itself might also increase in size. When examining the volume for how much space your z/OS file system is using, check other product file system sizes too.

						<instructions>This portion of the Workflow will guide you to submit a job to run an IBM Health Check for z/OS associated with this migration action, 
							<strong>IBMUSS,ZOSMIGREC_ROOT_FS_SIZE</strong>. 
							<p>This check will be activated if it is not already active. If the check is activated, it will be deactivated at the end of the job, so that it remains in the same state as it was found.</p>  
							<p>If the health check runs with no exception, this step will be marked "Complete" indicating that this migration action requires no more activity.</p>  
							<p>If the health check finds an exception, this step will be marked as "Failed". This tells you that further investigation (and possibly more work) is necessary to complete this migration action. If the step is marked "Failed", you should review the health check output (via any method you use to view health check output, such as SDSF) and correct any situation that you find appropriate. You can then re-run this Workflow step to submit the health check job again, until the health check no longer receives an exception and the step is marked "Complete".</p>

					<description><![CDATA[  
						<h5 id="wq91">Description</h5>  
						<p>Over time, as various z/OS functions and applications exploit XCF services, you must ensure that there is enough space in the sysplex couple data set for all the XCF groups and members that are to be defined by the exploiters. It is possible that your sysplex couple data set could contain an inadequate number of XCF groups or members.</p> Note: Starting with z/OS V1R13, JES2 is using new XCF groups for its spool migration enhancement. JES spool migration utilizes tasks on all members of a MAS to manage the migration of a spool volume's data and the access to that migrating or migrated data. These various tasks communicate using messages sent through JESXCF services. The JESXCF services utilize one XCF group for each active migration to identify what messages are for which active migration. XCF groups are a limited system resource, so JES2 limits the number of concurrent active migrations to five. If you plan to perform spool migrations, verify that you have up to five XCF groups available if you intend to have up to five spool migrations active at any given time. JES2 will only utilize the number of XCF groups available, up to five, for spool migrations.

You must use the z/OS MVS libraries of IPCS code, for example, to analyze a dump or trace produced by that level of the z/OS MVS system.</p> Tip: If it is necessary to have unique IPCS data set names for your current system (because you already have the IPCS data sets with similar names on your earlier system), you can create a unique alias in your catalog that resolves to the current IPCS data sets. This will allow you to have duplicately-named IPCS data sets that are uniquely referenced.

The easiest way to do this is to create a clone of your current /var file system and then copy the new /var files into the clone.</p>  
						<p>Many z/OS UNIX utilities are available for comparing and copying directory structures and files. Two that are especially helpful for /etc and /var migration work are:</p>  
						<ul> 
							<li> 
								<strong>diff</strong>  
								<p>(with the 
									<strong>-r</strong> option, for recursion). This utility is very useful for comparing the path structures and file contents, and has many options available. The 
									<strong>dircmp</strong> utility has fewer options for directory comparisons, and the 
									<strong>cmp</strong> utility stops after the first difference in a file comparison and has output that is more cumbersome.
								</p> 
							</li>  
							<li> 
								<strong>pax</strong>  
								<p>. The 
									<strong>-rw</strong> option works like a copy (instead of making or extracting from a single file archive) for directories, symbolic links, and files. Consider the 
									<strong>-pe</strong> option for saving the attributes when doing the copy. The 
									<strong>-k</strong> option prevents overwriting of existing files. The 
									<strong>-C</strong> option causes 
									<strong>pax</strong> to continue after encountering an error on the source file system. That is, 
									<strong>pax</strong> prints an error message and returns a nonzero value after the command ends. Errors on the target file system (such as out of space or write errors) still cause the 
									<strong>pax</strong> command to end as it always has.
								</p> 
							</li> 
						</ul>  
						<p>To determine what you need to migrate, first compare the ServerPac /etc and /var file systems with your existing /etc and /var file systems. Mount a copy of your existing /etc and /var file systems to a location outside of the ServerPac file system. For instance, you might have your ServerPac file systems at /ServerPac/zOS_Rx/etc and /ServerPac/zOS_Rx/var, and your existing file systems at /Service/ImageX/etc and /Service/ImageX/var. You might have several file systems to mount that are copies of each of your image's /etc and /var file systems (ImageX, ImageY, and ImageZ, for instance). To compare the ServerPac and existing system's /etc and /var, you can run two z/OS UNIX commands, such as:</p>  
						<pre> 
<code>diff -r /ServerPac/zOS_Rx/etc /Service/ImageX/etc diff -r /ServerPac/zOS_Rx/var /Service/ImageX/var</code>
						</pre>  
						<p>These command results will give you a list of the changes that your existing system's /etc and /var file systems are missing--both the structure differences and the file content differences.</p>  
						<p>After you determine which directories, symbolic links, and files you are missing from your existing system, you can use one of several ways to propagate the ServerPac information forward:</p>  
						<ul> 
							<li> 
								<p>You could use the 
									<strong>pax</strong> command (with the 
									<strong>-k</strong> option) to copy from the ServerPac /etc and /var file systems to each of your existing system's /etc and /var file systems. For example:
								</p>  
								<pre> 
<code>cd /ServerPac/zOS_Rx/etc pax -rvwkC -pe * /Service/ImageX/etc</code>
								</pre>  
								<p>Another example:</p>  
								<pre> 
<code>cd /ServerPac/zOS_Rx/var pax -rvwkC -pe * /Service/ImageX/var</code>
								</pre>  
								<p>The 
									<strong>pax</strong> command is a good choice because it copies all files, directories, and symbolic links for each file system from the ServerPac system using a single command without overlaying any existing files.
								</p> 
							</li>  
							<li> 
								<p>You could rerun the product-supplied MKDIR jobs to recreate the directories and symbolic links on each of your existing system's /etc and /var file systems. (A list of the MKDIR jobs is found in 
									<cite>z/OS Program Directory</cite> and the other program directories for the products that were in your ServerPac order.) MKDIR jobs are designed to be run multiple times without damaging your existing file system. For the files under /var/ocsf, rerun the OCSF-supplied ocsf_install_crypto installation script. Or, you can combine these jobs and script them into a single batch job to make the execution more consolidated and repeatable.
								</p> 
							</li> 
						</ul>  
						<p>After you have made the changes to a copy of your existing image's /etc and /var file systems, you can unmount them and use them for your deployment of the ServerPac system, as your schedule indicates. Remember, you are using 
							<em>copies</em> of your existing /etc and /var file systems, and you are 
							<em>preserving</em> what you had previously by modifying copies, so your customization for those specific existing images is not lost.

						<p>Use the z/OS SMP/E Planning and Migration Assistant to help determine which user modifications need to be reworked and which just have to be reinstalled. The Top or New Intermediate Product Migration Changes Report uses data found on your system, combined with IBM-supplied information from the Software Information Base, to show you the current levels of products available as well as product migration and functional changes using a comparison of FMIDs. You can use this report to determine the product migration impacts by reviewing the "changed" FMIDs. This can help you assess how many user modifications have to be reworked if you issued the LIST SYSMOD USERMOD FORFMID (listing the "changed" FMIDs) command. All other user modifications can be reinstalled without having to be reworked.</p> Note: IBM recommends using exit routines for any user modifications where possible, and installing the exit routines with SMP/E. By using SMP/E, it is easier to bring forward modifications to the z/OS release you are installing.

						<p>Check with your ISVs to make sure the product levels you are using support the new z/OS release, and then reconnect your ISV products to the new release of z/OS following the instructions provided by the ISVs. If any ISV products do not need to be installed in the same libraries and zones as z/OS, place them in their own sets of libraries and SMP/E zones. This means that, unless you have to change ISV product code, such as installing PTFs, or obtain a new level of the product, you will not need to reinstall it after you install a new ServerPac.</p>

							<p>Virtual storage requirements can grow from release to release. You should review the virtual storage limits that you want to set. Generally, there are two areas of concern: common areas (above and below the 16 MB line) and individual address spaces. An increase in virtual storage for common areas reduces the virtual storage size of all address spaces. An increase in virtual storage for individual address spaces impacts only the individual address spaces.</p>

							<h5 id="wq271">Steps to take</h5>  
							<p>Determine how much virtual storage use to allow above the 2 GB bar. While there is no practical limit to the number of virtual addresses an address space can request above the bar, the system can limit the amount of virtual storage above the bar that an address space is allowed to use. The amount of virtual storage above the bar is determined as follows. The MEMLIMIT parameter in parmlib member SMFPRMxx sets the default system-wide limit, which defaults to 2 GB as of z/OS V1R10 (and zero before z/OS V1R10). However, the system-wide default MEMLIMIT can be overridden by specifying REGION=0M or MEMLIMIT on JOB or EXEC statements in JCL. To set a limit on the use of virtual storage above the bar, use the SMF exit IEFUSI. For more information, see "Limiting the use of memory objects" in 
								<cite>z/OS MVS Programming: Extended Addressability Guide</cite>.
							</p>  
							<p>If you want to control the use of virtual storage above the 2 GB bar, do one or more of the following:</p>  
							<ul> 
								<li> 
									<p>The MEMLIMIT default is 2 GB. If this 2 GB default value is acceptable to you, no change to SMFPRMxx is necessary. (Before z/OS V1R10, the default MEMLIMIT was zero, and you had to specify a nonzero MEMLIMIT in an active SMFPRMxx member of parmlib to establish a system default other than zero for available virtual storage above 2 GB.)</p> 
								</li>  
								<li> 
									<p>You can specify MEMLIMIT explicitly in JCL to override the system default that was set (or allowed to default) in SMFPRMxx.</p> 
								</li>  
								<li> 
									<p>You can specify REGION=0M on the job statement in JCL to implicitly set MEMLIMIT to NOLIMIT, which also overrides the system default (from SMFPRMxx).</p> 
								</li>  
								<li> 
									<p>You can use IEFUSI both to establish a system default MEMLIMIT for different classes of work (for example, JOB, TSO, STC) and limit the amount of virtual storage that can be used above the bar, provided that an explicit or implicit nonzero MEMLIMIT is in effect from JCL or SMFPRMxx. As of z/OS V1R10, keyword HONORIEFUSIREGION NOHONORIEFUSIREGION is available in SCHEDxx to identify if the region and MEMLIMIT settings specified through or otherwise affected by the IEFUSI exit are to take effect for a program. If you are overriding the attribute of HASJES20 (JES2) in SCHEDxx parmlib member, specify NOHONORIEFUSIREGION explicitly so the default of HONORIEFUSIREGION is not used for this program.</p>

						<instructions>This portion of the Workflow will guide you to submit a job to run an IBM Health Check for z/OS associated with this migration action, 
							<strong>IBMRSM,RSM_MEMLIMIT</strong>. 
							<p>This check will be activated if it is not already active. If the check is activated, it will be deactivated at the end of the job, so that it remains in the same state as it was found.</p>  
							<p>If the health check runs with no exception, this step will be marked "Complete" indicating that this migration action requires no more activity.</p>  
							<p>If the health check finds an exception, this step will be marked as "Failed". This tells you that further investigation (and possibly more work) is necessary to complete this migration action. If the step is marked "Failed", you should review the health check output (via any method you use to view health check output, such as SDSF) and correct any situation that you find appropriate. You can then re-run this Workflow step to submit the health check job again, until the health check no longer receives an exception and the step is marked "Complete".</p>

							<li> 
								<p>If you specified PDSESHARING(NORMAL), do not share PDSE data sets beyond the scope of the global resource serialization complex.</p> 
							</li>

								<p>If you specified PDSESHARING(EXTENDED), do not share PDSE data sets beyond the scope of the sysplex.</p> 
							</li> 
						</ul>

						<h5 id="wq543">Description</h5>  
						<p>The MAXUSER value in parmlib member IEASYSxx specifies a value that the system uses to limit the number of jobs and started tasks that can run concurrently during a given IPL. You might want to increase your MAXUSER value to take new address spaces into account.</p>  
						<p>The following elements add new address spaces for z/OS V2R2:</p>  
						<ul> 
							<li> 
								<p>IBM HTTP Server - Powered by Apache, which has one or more new address spaces that are associated with it. For information about setting up IBM HTTP Server - Powered by Apache, see 
									<cite>z/OS V2R2.0 HTTP Server - Powered by Apache User's Guide</cite> .
								</p> 
							</li>  
							<li> 
								<p>IBM Knowledge Center for z/OS. This new element in z/OS V2R2 is started in an address space that is an instance of the WebSphere Liberty Profile, which is installed with z/OSMF. For information about setting up IBM Knowledge Center for z/OS, see 
									<cite>IBM Knowledge Center for z/OS Configuration and User Guide</cite>.
								</p> 
							</li>  
							<li> 
								<p>IBM z/OS Management Facility (z/OSMF), which has the address spaces IZUANG1 and IZUSVR1. For information about setting up z/OSMF, see 
									<cite>IBM z/OS Management Facility Configuration Guide</cite> .
								</p> 
							</li> 
						</ul>  
						<p>The following address spaces were new for z/OS V2R1:</p>  
						<ul> 
							<li> 
								<p>SDSFAUX (SDSF). With APAR PI43902 (also applicable to z/OS V2R2), SDSF is enhanced with a new, optional address space called SDSFAUX, which provides information about the systems in the sysplex, and their various data set concatenations. The information is shown on the following new SDSF panels and their associated commands: APF, LNK, LPA, PAG, PARM, and SYS.</p>  
								<p>The SDSFAUX address space is automatically started by the SDSF server address space when the server starts, and is automatically stopped when the SDSF server is stopped.</p>  
								<p>For more information about SDSFAUX, see 
									<cite>z/OS SDSF Operation and Customization</cite>.
								</p> 
							</li>  
							<li> 
								<p>PCIE (PCI Express) and FPGHWAM (Hardware Accelerator Manager). These address spaces provide the infrastructure for PCI Express I/O and hardware accelerator activities. They are started automatically, if z/OS is IPLed on a hardware server capable of supporting the appropriate z/OS PCIE facilities, even if the PCIE facilities are not available on the server. This capability is available on a zEC12 or zBC12 or later. They are persistent address spaces. It is recommended that you do not stop them if any other subsystem relies on them.</p>  
								<p>When the PCIE and FPGHWAM address spaces are successfully initialized, the following message is displayed:</p>  
								<pre> 
<code>IQP002I PCIE INITIALIZATION COMPLETE</code>
								</pre>  
								<p>If z/OS is IPLed on a server that precedes the zEC12 or zBC12, the following message is written to the hardcopy log:</p>  
								<pre> 
<code>IQP031I REQUESTED SERVICE IS UNSUPPORTED BY HARDWARE</code>
								</pre>  
								<p>For information about the PCIE messages, see 
									<cite>z/OS MVS System Messages, Vol 9 (IGF-IWM)</cite>. For information about the FPGHWAM (Hardware Accelerator Manager) messages, see 
									<cite>z/OS MVS System Messages, Volume 5 (EDG-GFS)</cite>.
								</p>  
								<p>PCIE and FPGHWAM do not require any security customization. However, if you are using any enhancements that use this infrastructure, check the documentation for those enhancements to ensure that you apply any specific security customization that might be required for their use.</p> 
							</li>  
							<li> 
								<p>IBM Health Checker for z/OS. As of z/OS V2R1 the system starts IBM Health Checker for z/OS address space automatically during system initialization.</p>  
								<p>For information, see 
									<a href="#hcsetup">Convert your existing IBM Health Checker for z/OS setup for automatic start-up</a>.
								</p> 
							</li>  
							<li> 
								<p>JES2 Converter/Interpreter. A new persistent address space is used when the interpretation process is performed for a job during the JES2 conversion phase. The address space is only created when INTERPRET=JES is specified on JOBDEF. The number of address spaces that are used depends on the CISUB_PER_AS setting on JOBDEF. The number of conversion processes (PCEDEF CNVTNUM=) divided by the number of subtasks per address space (CISUB_PER_AS) gives the number of address spaces created. The default number of created address spaces is 2 and the maximum number is 25.</p>  
								<p>The address spaces are named jesxCInn, where jesx is the JES2 subsystem name and xx is a number (01 - 25) to create uniqueness. This address space accesses the PROCLIB data sets defined in the JES2 start PROC and using the JES2 dynamic PROCLIB service.</p>  
								<p>You must ensure that a proper user ID is assigned to the address space (presumably the same user ID that is assigned to the JES2 address space) by using entries in either the started procedures table (ICHRIN03) or that a STARTED class profile has been defined that matches each new address space names. If you prefer, both the started procedures table and STARTED class profile might be in place. This action ensures that the correct user ID is assigned.</p>

								<p>Generic Tracker (GTZ). As of z/OS V2R1, GTZ replaces the Console Tracking Facility with enhanced capabilities to track use of system functions. For information, see

						<h5 id="wq555">Steps to take</h5>  
						<p>If necessary, increase your MAXUSER value in parmlib member IEASYSxx to accommodate the new address spaces. One way to determine how many address spaces you use is to enter the 
							<strong>DISPLAY A,L</strong> command. Then, add the number of address spaces in the IEE114I and IEE115I messages on the old and new systems to determine the total number.
						</p> Note: 
						<ul> 
							<li> 
								<p>A modest overspecification of MAXUSER should not affect system performance.</p> 
							</li>  
							<li> 
								<p>The number of total address spaces is the sum of M/S, TS USERS, SYSAS, and INITS.</p> 
							</li>  
							<li> 
								<p>If you change the MAXUSER value, you must re-IPL to make the change effective.</p>

					<h5 id="wq558">Description</h5>  
					<p>The IBM z13™ (z13) and IBM z13s 
						<sup>TM</sup> (z13s) are the newest IBM z Systems mainframes, and are distinct from the earlier zEnterprise and other systems. In this publication, these systems are referred to as the z13 and the z13s. z/OS V2R2 running on the z13 or z13s sets the groundwork for digital business by providing the foundation you need to support demanding workloads, such as operational analytics and clouds, and your traditional mission-critical applications.
					</p>  
					<p>In a Parallel Sysplex that includes a z13 or z13s with either a z/OS system running in at least one LPAR or at least one LPAR being used as a coupling facility (CF), you can include the following servers:</p>  
					<ul> 
						<li> 
							<p>z13 and z13s servers</p> 
						</li>  
						<li> 
							<p>zEC12 and zBC12 servers</p> 
						</li>  
						<li> 
							<p>zEnterprise servers (z196 or z114)</p> 
						</li> 
					</ul>  
					<p>The specific z13 and z13s functions, including base support, that are used by z/OS depend on the z/OS release. PTFs might be required for many of these functions. See 
						<a href="#z13bef21">Actions you can take before you order a z13 or z13s server</a> for information about finding the appropriate PTFs.

						<description><![CDATA[  
							<p>As you plan your migration to a z13 or z13s 
								<sup>TM</sup> server, consider the following:
							</p>  
							<ol> 
								<li> 
									<strong>Relatively few migration actions are new when coming from an IBM zEnterprise EC12 or zEnterprise BC12 server.</strong>  
									<p>Migration to an IBM z13 or IBM z13s server has, as its base, a migration to the IBM zEnterprise EC12 or zEnterprise BC12 servers. This means that if you are migrating to a z13 or z13s server from a zEC12 or zBC12 server, and have performed the migration actions associated with the zEC12 or zBC12, you have fewer migration actions than if you were migrating from an earlier generation server and have not yet performed the migration actions associated with these servers. It is important to note that you can migrate directly to a z13 or z13s server without installing the intermediate servers, but you still need to ensure that any migration considerations are satisfied for the servers that you "skipped." To read about z196, z114, zEC12, and zBC12 server migration actions, see 
										<a href="#mignext">Migrate to an IBM zEnterprise z196 or z114 server</a> and 
										<a href="#znext21">Migrate to an IBM zEnterprise EC12 or IBM zEnterprise BC12 server</a>.
									</p> 
								</li>  
								<li> 
									<strong>Support is delivered by service, z/OS features, and web deliverables.</strong>  
									<p>The base support for the z13 and z13s is delivered by service (PTFs).</p>  
									<ul> 
										<li> 
											<p>The PSP bucket that contains the required list of PTFs for the z13 server is: Upgrade 2964DEVICE, Subset 2964/ZOS and is identified by the following SMP/E Fix Category IBM.Device.Server.z13-2964.RequiredService</p> 
										</li>  
										<li> 
											<p>The PSP bucket that contains the required list of PTFs for the z13s server is: Upgrade 2965DEVICE, Subset 2965/ZOS and is identified by the following SMP/E Fix Category IBM.Device.Server.z13S-2965.RequiredService.</p> 
										</li> 
									</ul>  
									<p>Exploitation of some functions requires a web deliverable. Specifically:</p>  
									<ul> 
										<li> 
											<p>If you are running z/OS V2R1 and require Crypto Express4S functionality for CCA 4.4 and other EP11 cryptographic enhancement support which includes: RKX Key Export Wrap, UDX Reduction/simplification, additional EP11 algorithms, expanded EMV support, AP Configuration simplification, CTRACE Enhancements, and KDS Key Utilization Stats, then you must download and install the Cryptographic Support for z/OS V1R13-z/OS V2R1 web deliverable (FMID HCR77A1) or the Cryptographic Support for z/OS V1R13 - z/OS V2R2 web deliverable (HCR77B1).</p>  
											<p>If you are using either of these web deliverables (HCR77A1 or HCR77B1) and sharing keys with other z/OS systems that have a lower-level of ICSF, you require the coexistence PTFs identified by the appropriate Fix Category: IBM.Coexistence.ICSF.z/OS_V1R13-z/OS_V2R1-HCR77A1 or IBM.Coexistence.ICSF.z/OS_V1R13-z/OS_V2R1-HCR77B1.</p> 
										</li>  
										<li> 
											<p>If you are running z/OS V2R1 and require Crypto Express5S exploitation support for the next Generation Coprocessor support or VISA Format Preserving Encryption (FPE), you must download and install the Enhanced Cryptographic Support for z/OS V1R13-z/OS V2R1 web deliverable (FMID HCR77B0) or the Cryptographic Support for z/OS V1R13 - z/OS V2R2 web deliverable (HCR77B1).</p>  
											<p>If you are using either of these web deliverables (HCR77B0 or HCR77B1) and sharing keys with other z/OS systems that have a lower-level of ICSF, you require the coexistence PTFs identified by the appropriate Fix Category: IBM.Coexistence.ICSF.z/OS_V1R13-z/OS_V2R1-HCR77B0 or IBM.Coexistence.ICSF.z/OS_V1R13-z/OS_V2R1-HCR77B1.</p> 
										</li>  
										<li> 
											<p>If you are running z/OS V2R1 and require exploitation of new hardware instructions using XL C/C++ ARCH(11) and TUNE(11) including SIMD, vector programming, MASS and ATLAS libraries, you must download and install the XL C/C++ V2R1M1 web deliverable with z13 support for z/OS 2.1.</p> 
										</li>  
										<li> 
											<p>If you are running z/OS V1R13 and want to exploit Flash Express (including pageable 1 MB Large Page Support, optional paging of PLPA and Common (CSA, ECSA) pages to Flash Express, and Dynamic reconfiguration support for Flash Express); or 2 GB Large Page support, you must download and install the z/OS V1.13 RSM Enablement Offering Web deliverable and install the required PTFs identified by the Fix Category.</p> 
										</li>  
										<li> 
											<p>If you are running z/OS V1R13, you might need to install a Cryptographic Support web deliverable, depending on which ICSF functions you require.</p> 
										</li> 
									</ul> 
								</li>  
								<li> 
									<strong>Larger coupling facility structure sizes might be necessary.</strong>  
									<p>When you change coupling facility control code (CFCC) levels, your coupling facility structure sizes might change. If, as part of your migration to a z13 server, you change CFCC levels, you might have larger structure sizes than you did previously. If your CFCC levels are identical, structure sizes are not expected to change when you migrate from a previous server to a newer generation server. In addition, similar to CF Level 17 and later, ensure that the CF LPAR has at least 512MB of storage. CFCC Levels 20 and 21, introduced on the z13 and 13s, support the Coupling Facility use of Large Memory to improve availability for larger CF cache structures and data sharing performance with larger DB2 Group Buffer Pools (GBP). This support removes inhibitors to using large CF cache structures, enabling use of Large Memory to appropriately scale to larger DB2 Local Buffer Pools (LBP) and Group Buffer Pools (GBP) in data sharing environments.</p> 
								</li>  
								<li> 
									<strong>Use the same software level throughout a sysplex.</strong>  
									<p>Having members of a sysplex at the same software level (other than during brief migration periods) is good software management policy.</p> 
								</li>  
								<li> 
									<strong>Migrate hardware and software at different times.</strong>  
									<p>To minimize the amount of change (and therefore risk) that you experience at one time, do not migrate your software release level at the same time that you migrate your hardware.</p> 
								</li>  
								<li> 
									<strong>Update SCRT to latest version.</strong>  
									<p>If you use SCRT, make sure it is at the latest level. This is a requirement for sub-capacity pricing, as well as when you upgrade servers. The latest level of SCRT can be downloaded from the SCRT web site at 
										<a href="http://www.ibm.com/systems/z/resources/swprice/subcap/scrt/">http://www.ibm.com/eserver/zseries/swprice/scrt/</a>.

						<instructions>This portion of the Workflow will guide you to submit a job to run an IBM Health Check for z/OS associated with this migration action, 
							<strong>IBMIOS,IOS_FABRIC_MONITOR</strong>. 
							<p>This check will be activated if it is not already active. If the check is activated, it will be deactivated at the end of the job, so that it remains in the same state as it was found.</p>  
							<p>If the health check runs with no exception, this step will be marked "Complete" indicating that this migration action requires no more activity.</p>  
							<p>If the health check finds an exception, this step will be marked as "Failed". This tells you that further investigation (and possibly more work) is necessary to complete this migration action. If the step is marked "Failed", you should review the health check output (via any method you use to view health check output, such as SDSF) and correct any situation that you find appropriate. You can then re-run this Workflow step to submit the health check job again, until the health check no longer receives an exception and the step is marked "Complete".</p>

					<title>Restrictions for a z13 or z13s server</title>  
					<description><![CDATA[  
						<p>Restrictions associated with z13 and z13s 
							<sup>TM</sup> servers are described as follows:
						</p>  
						<ol> 
							<li> 
								<strong>Functional limitations.</strong>  
								<p>Not all z13 or z13s functions are available in every z/OS release. See 
									<a href="#z13__znextfuncbc">Table 28</a> and 
									<a href="#z13__z13exploitation">Table 29</a> for a list of the z13 and z13s functions available in each z/OS release. Some functions have migration or exploitation considerations (see 
									<a href="#z13bef21">Actions you can take before you order a z13 or z13s server</a> and 
									<a href="#znextaft21">Migration and exploitation considerations for z13 and z13s server functions</a>. ) Many functions are enabled or disabled, based on the presence or absence of the required hardware and software. If you plan to exploit new z13 or z13s functions, you can install the software and hardware in either order; that is, there is no requirement to install either software or hardware first to exploit a specific function. However, because of outage windows and testing considerations, you might want to consider installing all the software and PTFs required for the machine and the functions you plan to exploit first, then upgrade the hardware and, finally, update your customization to exploit the new functions.
								</p> 
							</li>  
							<li> 
								<strong>z13 and z13s servers in a sysplex.</strong>  
								<ul> 
									<li> 
										<p>A Parallel Sysplex that contains a z13 or z13s server either for a z/OS image or a CF image can only contain other z13 or z13s servers, or z196, z114, zEC12, or zBC12 servers.</p>  
										<p>If you are running z/OS on any servers earlier than a z196 or z114 server, you cannot add a z13 or z13s server to that sysplex; that is, you will not be able to perform rolling IPLs to introduce a z13 or z13s server if you have any of the earlier servers as z/OS images or coupling facility images in the sysplex.</p>  
										<p>The earlier servers in the sysplex must be upgraded to z196, z114, or later to have z13 or z13s servers supported in the sysplex. If you have any z/OS images or coupling facility images on an earlier server, and you intend to introduce a z13 or z13s server into that sysplex, you must migrate those images to a z196, z114, or later server before introducing the z13 or z13s server.</p>  
										<p>GRS supports the use of FICON CTCs for Ring configurations on z/OS V1R13 with a PTF and on z/OS Version 2. However, if you are currently using ESCON CTCs for GRS ring configurations within a sysplex, consider converting to GRS Star if possible, or using XCF signalling in a GRS ring configuration. XCF sysplex signalling is preferred instead of GRS CTC connections.</p> 
									</li>  
									<li> 
										<p>InterSystem Channel 3 (ISC-3) and Integrated Cluster Bus 4 (ICB-4) Coupling Links are not supported on z13 or z13s CPC. Instead, the IBM Integrated Coupling Adapter (ICA SR), introduced on the z13 and z13s, is a two-port, short distance coupling fanout that utilizes a new coupling channel type: CS5. The ICA SR can only be used for coupling connectivity between z13 or z13s servers, and the ICA SR can only connect to another ICA SR. IBM recommends that you order ICA SR (#0172) on the z13 processors used in a Parallel Sysplex to help ensure coupling compatibility with future processor generations. You can also use 12x InfiniBand coupling links, which are designed to replace Integrated Cluster Bus 4 (ICB-4), and to complement 1x InfiniBand and ISC-3 on a z13 or z13s server. InfiniBand coupling can provide significantly improved service times compared to ISC-3s for distances up to 150 meters. You can read about coupling links in 
											<em>IBM System z® Connectivity Handbook</em> (SG24-5444).
										</p> 
									</li>  
									<li> 
										<p>The z13 or z13s server cannot be connected to a Sysplex Timer (9037-002). The Server Time Protocol (STP) feature is the follow-on to the Sysplex Timer. STP is designed to allow multiple servers and coupling facilities to maintain time synchronization with each other without requiring a Sysplex Timer. STP is a hardware feature of the z13, z13s, zEC12, zBC12, z196, and z114. To implement STP, see the STP web site and the publications and other resources listed there. The STP web site is at 
											<a href="http://www.ibm.com/systems/z/advantages/pso/stp.html" target="_blank">http://www.ibm.com/systems/z/advantages/pso/stp.html</a> .
										</p>  
										<p>The STP design introduced a concept called Coordinated Timing Network (CTN). A CTN is a collection of servers and coupling facilities that are time-synchronized to a time value called Coordinated Server Time. A CTN can be configured in two ways:</p>  
										<ul> 
											<li> 
												<p>STP-only CTN, which does not require a Sysplex Timer. A z13 or z13s must participate in an STP-only CTN.</p> 
											</li>  
											<li> 
												<p>Mixed-CTN (External Time Reference and STP), which does require a Sysplex Timer. zEC12 and zBC12 were the last servers to support mixed-CTN. The z13 and z13s do not support connections to a Mixed-CTN. All servers in the network must be configured in STP-only mode. Consider migrating servers that require time synchronization, such as to support a base or Parallel Sysplex, to the Server Time Protocol (STP).</p>

								<strong>Plan for discontinued functions.</strong>  
								<p>For a list of functions on the z13 server that are planned to be discontinued on future servers, see 
									<a href="#z132012hw1">Accommodate functions for the z13 server or z13s to be discontinued on future servers</a>.
								</p> 
							</li>  
							<li> 
								<strong>Unsupported hardware features.</strong>  
								<p>The following hardware features cannot be ordered and cannot be carried forward from an upgrade on an earlier server to the z13 server.</p>  
								<ul> 
									<li> 
										<p>HCA2-O</p> 
									</li>  
									<li> 
										<p>HCA2-O LR</p> 
									</li>  
									<li> 
										<p>ISC-3 links</p> 
									</li>  
									<li> 
										<p>CHPID type OSN (OSA-Express for NCP) is not supported on the OSA-Express5S GbE LX feature</p> 
									</li>  
									<li> 
										<p>Crypto Express3 (#0864)</p> 
									</li>  
									<li> 
										<p>Crypto Express4S (#0865)</p> 
									</li>  
									<li> 
										<p>STP Mixed CTN. The zEC12 and zBC12 were the last z Systems™ servers to support connections to an STP Mixed CTN. This also includes the Sysplex Timer (9037). Starting with z13, servers that require Time synchronization, such as to support a base or Parallel Sysplex, will require Server Time Protocol (STP) and all servers in that network must be configured in STP-only mode.</p> 
									</li>  
									<li> 
										<p>IBM System z Application Assist Processor (zAAP). IBM continues to support running zAAP workloads on IBM System z Integrated Information Processors (zIIPs). IBM has removed the restriction preventing zAAP-eligible workloads from running on zIIPs when a zAAP is installed on the CEC. This was intended to help facilitate migration and testing of zAAP workloads on zIIPs. With a z13, one CP must be installed with the installation of any zIIPs or prior to the installation of any zIIPs. The total number of zIIPs purchased cannot exceed twice the number of CPs purchased. However, for upgrades from zEC12s with zAAPs, conversions from zAAPs may increase this ratio to 4:1.</p> 
									</li> 
								</ul> 
							</li>  
							<li> 
								<strong>Carry forward hardware features.</strong>  
								<p>The following hardware features are not orderable on z13 servers. If they are installed on your existing server at the time of an upgrade to a z13 server, they can be retained or carried forward.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[  
						<p>You can perform the following migration actions before you order or install a z13 or z13s 
							<sup>TM</sup> server:
						</p>  
						<ol> 
							<li> 
								<strong>Review the sysplex configuration in which the z13 or z13s server will participate.</strong>  
								<p>See 
									<a href="#z13res21">Restrictions for a z13 or z13s server</a> for a description of the limitations when using z13 or z13s servers with certain earlier servers in a Parallel Sysplex.
								</p> 
							</li>  
							<li> 
								<strong>Implement an STP timing network.</strong>  
								<p>This action is needed because Sysplex Timers (9037-002) are not supported on z13 or z13s servers.</p> 
							</li>  
							<li> 
								<strong>Migrate from ISC-3 links to Infinband or Integrated Coupling Adapter (ICA) links.</strong>  
								<p>This action is needed because ISC-3 links are not supported on z13 or z13s servers. If desired, you can take this action after you order a z13 or z13s server, as you upgrade to the new server.</p> 
							</li>  
							<li> 
								<strong>Migrate from unsupported hardware features to newer technology.</strong>  
								<p>This action is needed because ESCON, FICON Express4, Crypto Express3, and OSA-Express3 are not supported on z13 or z13s servers. See 
									<a href="#z13res21">Restrictions for a z13 or z13s server</a>, 
									<a href="#at3ruio">Replace unsupported devices</a>, and 
									<a href="#au3ndv">Provide for new device installations</a>.
								</p> 
							</li>  
							<li> 
								<strong>Determine the level of cryptographic support you require on a z13 or z13s server.</strong>  
								<p>The level of function provided for cryptographic support differs by z/OS release and the installed ICSF web deliverable. Also, toleration PTFs are available for some cryptographic web deliverables.</p>  
								<p>For z/OS V2R2, consider the following:</p>  
								<ul> 
									<li> 
										<p>If you are using the level of ICSF that is shipped as part of z/OS V2R2, you can use the most functions of the Crypto Express5 feature on a z13 or z13s server.</p> 
									</li>  
									<li> 
										<p>The Cryptographic Support for z/OS V1R13 - z/OS V2R2 web deliverable (FMID HCR77B1) provides some additional function and also incorporates enhancements that are available in PTFs for the base level of ICSF included in z/OS V2R1. The web deliverable includes new operator commands with Parallel Sysplex wide scope that can be used to perform certain cryptographic administrative functions. These functions include activating, deactivating, and restarting cryptographic coprocessors. This support can also be used to display status for available cryptographic devices and information about active key data sets (KDSs).</p> 
									</li> 
								</ul>  
								<p>For z/OS V2R1, consider the following:</p>  
								<ul> 
									<li> 
										<p>If you are using the level of ICSF that is shipped as part of z/OS V2R1, you can tolerate Crypto Express5 on a z13 or z13s server, which treats Crypto Express5S cryptographic coprocessors and accelerators as Crypto Express4S coprocessors and accelerators. However, you must install the required PTFs identified by the SMP/E fix category:</p>  
										<ul> 
											<li> 
												<p>For the z13: IBM.Device.Server.z13-2964.RequiredService</p> 
											</li>  
											<li> 
												<p>For the z13s: IBM.Device.Server.z13S-2965.RequiredService</p> 
											</li> 
										</ul> 
									</li>  
									<li> 
										<p>If you require support for greater than 16 domains (up to 85) on Crypto Express5S, you must install the PTFs that are identified by the appropriate fix category IBM.Device.Server.z13-2964.Exploitation or IBM.Device.Server.z13S-2965.Exploitation, or install the Enhanced Cryptographic Support for z/OS V1R13-z/OS V2R1 web deliverable (FMID HCR77B0) or a later ICSF web deliverable.</p>

								<strong>Install the necessary z/OS service, as indicated in PSP buckets.</strong>  
								<p>You must obtain all of the appropriate Preventive Service Planning (PSP) buckets. In addition to the hardware PSP buckets, you must also obtain the software PSP buckets. Use the Fix Categories that are specified in the associated FIXCAT HOLDDATA to identify PTFs required for the z13 server, PTFs needed to exploit z13 capabilities, and PTFs recommended to fix known problems. Specifically, fixes in the following categories:</p>  
								<ul> 
									<li> 
										<p>For the z13:</p>  
										<ul> 
											<li>IBM.Device.Server.z13-2964.RequiredService</li>  
											<li>IBM.Device.Server.z13-2964.Exploitation</li>  
											<li>IBM.Device.Server.z13-2964.RecommendedService</li> 
										</ul> 
									</li>  
									<li> 
										<p>For the z13s:</p>  
										<ul> 
											<li>IBM.Device.Server.z13S-2965.RequiredService</li>  
											<li>IBM.Device.Server.z13S-2965.Exploitation</li>  
											<li>IBM.Device.Server.z13S-2965.RecommendedService</li> 
										</ul> 
									</li> 
								</ul>  
								<p>Fixes required for several zEnterprise functions (such as Parallel Sysplex InfiniBand Coupling Links, Server Time Protocol (STP), the Unified Resource Manager, High Performance FICON (zHPF), and zEnterprise Data Compression (zEDC) are not listed in the hardware PSP bucket, but can be found by using the following Fix Categories:</p>  
								<ul> 
									<li> 
										<p>For the z13:</p>  
										<ul> 
											<li>IBM.Device.Server.z13-2964.ParallelSysplexInfiniBandCoupling</li>  
											<li>IBM.Device.Server.z13-2964.ServerTimeProtocol</li>  
											<li>IBM.Device.Server.z13-2964.UnifiedResourceManager</li>  
											<li>IBM.Device.Server.z13-2964.zHighPerformanceFICON</li>  
											<li>IBM.Function.zEDC</li> 
										</ul> 
									</li>  
									<li> 
										<p>For the z13s:</p>  
										<ul> 
											<li>IBM.Device.Server.z13S-2965.ParallelSysplexInfiniBandCoupling</li>  
											<li>IBM.Device.Server.z13S-2965.ServerTimeProtocol</li>  
											<li>IBM.Device.Server.z13S-2965.UnifiedResourceManager</li>  
											<li>IBM.Device.Server.z13S-2965.zHighPerformanceFICON</li>  
											<li>IBM.Function.zEDC</li> 
										</ul> 
									</li> 
								</ul>  
								<p>Note that because the PTFs associated with these Fix Categories are not specific to a z13 server, you should consider specifying a generic wildcard for the server to ensure that you have all the appropriate service installed. For example:</p>  
								<ul> 
									<li>IBM.Device.Server.*.ParallelSysplexInfiniBandCoupling</li>  
									<li>IBM.Device.Server.*.ServerTimeProtocol</li>  
									<li>IBM.Device.Server.*.UnifiedResourceManager</li>  
									<li>IBM.Device.Server.*.zHighPerformanceFICON</li> 
								</ul>  
								<p>Similarly, fixes needed for zBX or to support the IBM DB2 Analytics Accelerator (IDAA) are not listed in the hardware PSP bucket, but can be found by using the following Fix Categories:</p>  
								<ul> 
									<li>IBM.Device.Server.zBX-2458</li>  
									<li>IBM.DB2.AnalyticsAccelerator.*</li> 
								</ul>  
								<p>If you are upgrading from a server generation prior to the zEC12 or zBC12 servers (such as a z196, z114, z10 EC, z10 BC, z9 EC, or z9 BC), you must install all the maintenance and perform required migration actions for the servers that you are skipping. To read about z196, z114, zEC12, and zBC12 server migration actions, see 
									<a href="#mignext">Migrate to an IBM zEnterprise z196 or z114 server</a> and 
									<a href="#znext21">Migrate to an IBM zEnterprise EC12 or IBM zEnterprise BC12 server</a>.
								</p>  
								<p>If you are exploiting z13 capabilities by installing a web deliverable, you must install the PTFs listed in the software PSP buckets for each of the web deliverables that you are installing. See the Program Directory associated with the web deliverable to identify the required software PSP buckets.</p>  
								<p>The REPORT MISSINGFIX command checks your GLOBAL zone for FIXCAT HOLDDATA matching the FIXCAT values specified on the command. The command then compares the APARs identified in that FIXCAT HOLDDATA with the PTFs installed in the specified zones, and produces a report to identify any APARs not resolved. In other words, it reports which PTFs (fixes) are missing for the specified fix categories. Furthermore, the command produces a customized job used to obtain any PTFs not already RECEIVEd via the RECEIVE ORDER command, and install any missing service via the APPLY CHECK command.</p>  
								<p>Note the FIXCAT operand on the REPORT MISSINGFIX command can list multiple fix categories, as well as using the same wildcarding techniques described in this topic for the SOURCEID operand. Because both of these techniques are simple and integrated into basic SMP/E commands, use them periodically to ensure the latest PTFs specified in the hardware and software PSP buckets are installed (since PSP buckets can be updated daily). SMP/E also provides an Explorer function which helps in identifying new fix categories which may be of interest. See the IBM fix category Values and Descriptions page for a description of all the fix categories: 
									<a href="http://www.ibm.com/systems/z/os/zos/features/smpe/fix-category.html">http://www.ibm.com/systems/z/os/zos/features/smpe/fix-category.html</a>. For complete information about the REPORT MISSINGFIX command, see 
									<cite>SMP/E for z/OS Commands</cite>.

								<strong>Run the CFSIZER tool.</strong>  
								<p>If you are moving your coupling facilities and the coupling facility structures will be on higher CFCC levels than they were previously, run the Coupling Facility Structure Sizer (CFSIZER) tool to find out if you have to increase coupling facility structure sizes. Prepare to make the necessary changes to the CFCC level as indicated by the tool.</p>  
								<p>You can download the CFSIZER tool at 
									<a href="http://www.ibm.com/systems/support/z/cfsizer/" target="_blank">Coupling Facility sizer (http://www.ibm.com/systems/support/z/cfsizer/)</a>. Also see 
									<a href="#au3cpfl">Update your CFRM policy with coupling facility structure size changes</a>.
								</p> Note: After you make a coupling facility available on the new hardware, you can run the Sizer utility, an authorized z/OS program, to evaluate structure size changes. The Sizer utility is distinct from CFSizer, and should be run after the new hardware (CFLEVEL) is installed, but before any CF LPAR on the new hardware is populated with structures. You can download the Sizer utility at 
								<a href="http://www.ibm.com/systems/support/z/cfsizer/altsize.html" target="_blank">http://www.ibm.com/systems/support/z/cfsizer/altsize.html</a>.
							</li>  
							<li> 
								<strong>Prepare for the new machine instruction mnemonics.</strong>  
								<p>In support of the z13 server, there are new machine instructions. The new machine instructions (mnemonics) may collide with (be identical to) the names of Assembler macro instructions you use. In the event of such collisions, the Assembler’s default opcode table (UNI) will treat specification of these names as instructions when the z13 required service is installed, probably causing Assembler error messages and possibly causing generation of incorrect object code. If you write programs in Assembler Language, compare the names of Assembler macro instructions used to the new machine instructions (documented in the latest 
									<cite>z/Architecture Principles of Operation</cite>, SA22-7832) to identify any such conflicts or collisions that would occur. Identical names will cause Assembler errors or the generation of incorrect object code when you assemble your programs. For a tool to help in identifying mnemonic conflicts, see 
									<cite>Techdoc PRS5289</cite> at the 
									<a href="http://www-03.ibm.com/support/techdocs/atsmastr.nsf/WebIndex/PRS5289">IBM Techdocs website</a>.
								</p>  
								<p>If a conflict is identified, take one of these actions:</p>  
								<ul> 
									<li> 
										<p>Change the name of your macro instruction.</p> 
									</li>  
									<li> 
										<p>Specify PARM=’...OPTABLE(YOP)...’ (or some other earlier opcode table).</p> 
									</li>  
									<li> 
										<p>Specify a separate ASMAOPT file containing assembler options such as in the previous method (this method requires no changes to source code or JCL).</p> 
									</li>  
									<li> 
										<p>Add as the first statement of your source program: *PROCESS OPTABLE(YOP) (or some other earlier opcode table).</p> 
									</li>  
									<li> 
										<p>Specify the PROFILE option either in JCL or the ASMAOPT file, and the specified or default member of the SYSLIB data set is copied into the front of the source program.</p> 
									</li>  
									<li> 
										<p>If you must use both a new instruction and a macro with the same name in an assembly you can use a coding technique that permits both use of a new instruction and a macro with the same name in an assembly such as HLASM mnemonic tags (:MAC :ASM).</p>

					<title>Migration and exploitation considerations for z13 and z13s server functions</title>  
					<description><![CDATA[  
						<p>The following z13 and z13s 
							<sup>TM</sup> functions have considerations when you are planning for migration and exploitation. For PTF information, see the Notes® for 
							<a href="#z13__znextfuncbc">Table 28</a>.
						</p>  
						<ol> 
							<li> 
								<strong>Large Systems Performance Reference (LSPR) method</strong>  
								<p>. LSPR is designed to provide comprehensive z/Architecture® processor capacity ratios for different configurations of central processors (CPs) across a wide variety of system control programs and workload environments.</p> 
							</li>  
							<li> 
								<strong>Simultaneous multithreading (SMT).</strong>  
								<p>Incremental throughput is achieved partly because the new processor chip offers intelligently implemented 2-way simultaneous multithreading. Simultaneous multithreading allows two active instruction streams per core, each dynamically sharing the core's execution resources. SMT is available on the z13 for workloads that are running on the Integrated Facility for Linux (IFL) and the IBM z Integrated Information Processor (zIIP).</p> 
							</li>  
							<li> 
								<strong>CFCC Level 20 and CFCC Level 21 support.</strong>  
								<p>CFCC Levels 20 and 21 support the Coupling Facility use of Large Memory to improve availability for larger CF cache structures and data sharing performance with larger DB2 Group Buffer Pools. This support removes inhibitors to using large CF cache structures, enabling use of Large Memory to appropriately scale to larger DB2 Local Buffer Pools and Group Buffer Pools in data sharing environments.</p> 
							</li>  
							<li> 
								<strong>Coupling links.</strong>  
								<p>IBM z13 introduced new PCIe (Integrated Coupling Adapter - ICA SR) based Short Reach coupling links using a new CHPID type, CS5. ICA-SR links can only connect z13 and z13s CPCs to other z13 and z13s CPCs.</p>  
								<p>IBM z13 and z13s CPC now support up to 256 links. A single z/OS or a CF Image supports a maximum of 128 links. When displaying STP (DISPLAY ETR) from a z/OS image, information is provided for the entire CPC. If more than 128 links are defined, the z/OS support must be installed on all z/OS releases running on that CPC, so that information about more than 128 links, including STP timing information, can be displayed.</p> 
							</li>  
							<li> 
								<strong>SIMD.</strong>  
								<p>z/OS V2R1 (and later) is designed to support the new vector extension facility (Single Instruction Multiple Data, SIMD) instructions available on IBM z13 servers. SIMD provides a powerful framework for development of new Business Analytics workloads, porting math-intensive workloads from other platforms, and accelerating Business Analytics workloads on IBM z13 and z13s servers. High Data Intensity, High Computational Intensity, Predictive IT Analytics, Advanced Security/Crypto, BI Reporting, Perspective Analytics, and Next-Generation Data Warehousing are some of the workloads that may benefit from Data Parallelism (SIMD). z/OS support includes enablement of Vector Registers (VR) on IBM z13 and z13s servers, Mathematical Acceleration Subsystem (MASS), and Automatically Tuned Linear Algebra Software (ATLAS) support, as well as Language Environment enablement for C runtime functions.</p> 
							</li>  
							<li> 
								<strong>Cryptographic Enhancements</strong>  
								<p>. Cryptographic enhancements for z/OS V2R1 (and later) on z13 servers include:</p>  
								<ul> 
									<li> 
										<p>VISA Format Preserving Encryption (VFPE). Support for VFPE algorithms in CCA-based callable services helps legacy databases to contain encrypted data of sensitive fields without having to restructure the database or applications. This support relies on the Crypto Express5S coprocessor.</p> 
									</li>  
									<li> 
										<p>Greater than 16 Domain support. This support allows a cryptographic coprocessor to be shared across more than 16 domains, up to the maximum number of LPARs on the system. This support relies on enhanced firmware available with a minimum microcode level for the Crypto Express5S coprocessor.</p> 
									</li>  
									<li> 
										<p>Trusted Key Entry (TKE) 8.0 Licensed Internal Code (LIC). This support includes Crypto Express5S Coprocessor support, FIPS Certified Smart Card, Crypto Coprocessors with more than 16 domains, a full-function migration wizard for EP11 coprocessors, new master key management functions, a Smart Card Readers Available indicator, a Configure Displayed Hash Size utility, ECC Authority Signature Keys, print capability, new features in the Crypto Node Management (CNM) utility, ENC-Zero verification pattern for 24-byte DES operational keys, and usability enhancements.</p>

									<strong>Decide on the steps you will take for your migration to a z13 server</strong> in 
									<a href="#z13bef21">Actions you can take before you order a z13 or z13s server</a> 
								</p> 
							</li>  
							<li> 
								<strong>IBM zAware system</strong>  
								<p>. The IBM zAware feature is designed to offer a near real-time, continuous learning, and diagnostics capability intended to help you pinpoint and resolve potential problems quickly enough to minimize impacts to your business. The new version of IBM zAware introduces a new generation of technology with improved analytics to provide better results. After you order a z13 or z13s server, you can prepare to set up an IBM zAware environment by defining the IBM zAware logical partition, defining and using OPERLOG log streams, and network definitions to connect the z/OS LPAR to the zAware LPAR. For more information, see 
									<cite>IBM System z Advanced Workload Analysis Reporter (IBM zAware) Guide</cite>, (SC27-2623), and 
									<cite>z/OS MVS Setting Up a Sysplex</cite>.
								</p> 
							</li>  
							<li> 
								<strong>Java exploitation</strong>  
								<p>. This support is added by:</p>  
								<ul> 
									<li> 
										<p>IBM 31-bit SDK for z/OS, Java Technology Edition, Version 8 (5655-DGG)</p> 
									</li>  
									<li> 
										<p>IBM 64-bit SDK for z/OS, Java Technology Edition, Version 8 (5655-DGH)</p> 
									</li> 
								</ul> 
							</li>  
							<li> 
								<strong>Flash Express</strong>  
								<p>. With this support, z/OS is designed to help improve system availability and responsiveness by using Flash Express across transitional workload events such as market openings, and diagnostic data collection. z/OS is also designed to help improve processor performance by supporting middleware exploitation of pageable large (1 MB) pages. This support requires the Flash Express hardware feature.</p> 
							</li>  
							<li> 
								<strong>2GB Large Page support</strong>  
								<p>. This support includes support for 2 GB large fixed pages.</p> 
							</li>  
							<li> 
								<strong>New z/Architecture instructions: XL C/C++ ARCH(11) and TUNE(11) parameters</strong>  
								<p>. This function provides new hardware instruction support, including support for the vector facility, the decimal floating point packed conversion facility, and numerous performance improvements (machine model scheduling and code generation updates). Single Instruction Multiple Data (SIMD) instruction set and execution support is provided through the new vector support in the compiler, including Business Analytics vector processing through the MASS and ATLAS libraries. Unlike prior generations of servers, to use any of these functions on z/OS V2R1, you must download and install the XL C/C++ V2R1M1 web deliverable with z13 support for z/OS 2.1.</p> 
							</li>  
							<li> 
								<strong>FICON Express16S</strong>  
								<p>. FICON Express16S supports a link data rate of 16 gigabits per second (GBPS) and auto-negotiation to 4 or 8 GBPS for synergy with existing switches, directors, and storage devices. With support for native FICON, High Performance FICON for System z (zHPF), and Fibre Channel Protocol (FCP), the new FICON Express16S channel is designed to work with your existing fiber optic cabling environment. The FICON Express16S feature running at end-to-end 16 GBPS link speeds provides reduced latency for large read/write operations, and increased bandwidth compared to the FICON Express8S feature.</p> 
							</li>  
							<li> 
								<strong>FICON Dynamic Routing</strong>  
								<p>. With z13, FICON channels are no longer restricted to the use of static Storage Area Network (SAN) routing policies for Inter-Switch Links (ISLs) for cascaded FICON directors. You need to ensure that all devices in your FICON SAN support FICON Dynamic Routing before implementing this feature.</p> 
							</li>  
							<li> 
								<strong>Improved High Performance FICON for System z (zHPF) I/O Execution at Distance</strong>  
								<p>. High Performance FICON for System z (zHPF) has been enhanced to allow all large write operations (&gt; 64 KB) at distances up to 100 km to be executed in a single return trip to the control unit, thereby not elongating the I/O service time for these write operations at extended distances.</p> 
							</li>  
							<li> 
								<strong>Improved Channel Subsystem (CSS) Scalability</strong>  
								<p>. The IBM z Systems servers have improved the channel subsystem (CSS) scalability, as follows:</p>  
								<ul> 
									<li> 
										<p>The z13 server improves CSS scalability with support for six logical channel subsystems (LCSSs), which are required to support the 85 LPARs for z13, four subchannel sets (to support more devices per logical channel subsystem), and 32K devices per FICON channel, up from 24K channels in the previous generation. Additionally, a fourth subchannel set for each LCSS is provided to facilitate elimination of single points of failure for storage after a disk failure.</p> 
									</li>  
									<li> 
										<p>The z13s server improves CSS scalability with support for three logical channel subsystems (LCSSs) which are required to support the 40 LPARs for IBM z13s, three subchannel sets (to support more devices per logical channel subsystem), and 32K devices per FICON channel up from 24K channels in the previous generation. Additionally, a third subchannel set for each logical channel subsystem (LCSS) is provided to facilitate elimination of single points of failure for disk storage devices.</p> 
									</li> 
								</ul> 
							</li>  
							<li> 
								<strong>PCIe and HCD Definitions.</strong> z/OS V2R1, and z/OS V2R1 HCD (FMID HCS7790) 
								<p>support full exploitation for z13 and z13s processors ( types 2964 and 2965) with support for up to 6 channel subsystems and 4 subchannel sets. To support PCIe functions for systems that are running on zEC12, zBC12, z13, or z13s servers, HCD introduced a new dialog for defining PCIe functions and assigning the functions to LPARs.</p>  
								<p>z/OS V1R13 HCD (HCS7780) supports limited exploitation for z13 and z13s servers ( types 2964 and 2965). For PCIE functions, it is possible to define complete types 2964 and 2965 servers, including PCIe functions and the new channel types and capabilities. However, a processor configuration can be dynamically changed or activated only if it contains neither PCIe function nor a PNETID attribute. For a software activation with hardware validation, PCIe functions and the PNETID attribute are ignored.</p>  
								<p>IBM recommends that you define and activate all the new hardware definitions on a z/OS V2R2 system, or on a V2R1 system with the appropriate HCD PTF (APAR OA44294) installed and perform software activations (with hardware validation) only on lower-level systems.</p> 
							</li>  
							<li> 
								<strong>Consider the changes in the CPU Measurement Facility counters.</strong>  
								<p>The number of CPU measurement facility counters for z13 and z13s servers remains at 128. Though the structure of the SMF 113 record does not change, the values, interpretations, and frequency of certain sections do change; therefore, current tools that use the data must be updated for the z13 and z13s servers.</p>  
								<p>For example, consider the following SMF record field:</p>  
								<ul> 
									<li> 
										<p>SMF113_2_CtrVN2 identifies how to interpret the MT-Diagnostic, Crypto, and Extended Counter Sets. As described in 
											<cite>The IBM CPU Measurement Facility Extended Counters Definition for z10 and z196</cite>, SA23-2260, this field is set to 1 (for z10), 2 (for z196 or z114), 3 (for zEC12 and zBC12), or 4 (for z13 and z13s).
										</p> 
									</li> 
								</ul> Note: As of z/OS V2R1, if you use the CPU Measurement Facility, IBM recommends that your installation collect SMF 113 subtype 1 and 2 records. IBM also recommends that products process SMF 113 subtype 1 records when available because that is where future enhancements will be made. If subtype 1 records are not available, products can process subtype 2 records.

						<h5 id="z132012hw1__descriptionhwz13dis">Description</h5>  
						<p>The following changes in hardware support could affect your environment. Make the appropriate changes, as needed.</p>  
						<ul> 
							<li> 
								<strong>Removal of support for running an operating system in ESA/390 architecture mode.</strong>  
								<p>The z13 and z13s 
									<sup>TM</sup> are the last z Systems servers to support running in ESA/390 mode. All future systems will only support operating systems running in z/Architecture mode. However, all 24-bit and 31-bit problem-state application programs originally written to run on the ESA/390 architecture will be unaffected by this change.
								</p> 
							</li>  
							<li> 
								<strong>Removal of support for Classic Style User Interface on the Hardware Management Console and Support Element.</strong>  
								<p>The z13 and z13s are the last z Systems servers to support Classic Style User Interface. In the future, user interface enhancements will be focused on the Tree Style User Interface.</p> 
							</li>  
							<li> 
								<strong>Removal of support for the Hardware Management Console Common Infrastructure Model (CIM) Management Interface.</strong>  
								<p>The z13 and z13s are the last z Systems servers to support the Hardware Console Common Infrastructure module (CIM) Management Interface. The Hardware Management Console Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP), and Web Services Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) will continue to be supported.</p> 
							</li>  
							<li> 
								<strong>Removal of FICON Express8 support.</strong>  
								<p>The z13 and z13s are the last z Systems servers to support FICON Express8. You should begin migrating from FICON Express8 channel features (#3325, #3326) to FICON Express16S channel features (#0418, #0419). FICON Express8 will not be supported on future high-end z Systems servers as carry forward on an upgrade.</p> 
							</li>  
							<li> 
								<strong>Removal of support for ordering FICON Express8S channel features.</strong>  
								<p>Enterprises that have 2GB device connectivity requirements must carry forward these channels.</p> 
							</li>  
							<li> 
								<strong>Removal of an option for the way shared logical processors are managed under PR/SM™ LPAR.</strong>  
								<p>The z13 and z13s are the last z Systems servers to support selection of the option "Do not end the timeslice if a partition enters a wait state" when the option to set a processor run-time value has been previously selected in the CPC RESET profile. The CPC RESET profile applies to all shared logical partitions on the machine, and is not selectable by logical partition.</p> 
							</li>  
							<li> 
								<strong>Removal of support for configuring OSN CHPID types.</strong>  
								<p>OSN CHPIDs are used to communicate between an operating system instance running in one logical partition and the Communications Controller for Linux (CCL) product in another logical partition on the same CPC. See announcement letter #914-227 dated 12/02/2014 for details regarding withdrawal from marketing for the CCL product.</p>

					<p>An IBM zEnterprise EC12 (zEC12) and IBM zEnterprise BC12 (zBC12) server can include the following in a zEnterprise environment:</p>  
					<ul> 
						<li> 
							<p>IBM zEnterprise EC12 server Central Processing Complex (CPC) or IBM zEnterprise BC12 server CPC</p>

						</li>  
						<li> 
							<p>zEnterprise Unified Resource Manager (Unified Resource Manager)</p> 
						</li> 
					</ul>  
					<p>The zEC12 and zBC12 are distinct from the earlier zEnterprise and other servers. In this publication, the IBM zEnterprise EC12 server is referred to as the model zEC12 server and the IBM zEnterprise BC12 server is referred to as the model zBC12 server.</p>  
					<p>In a Parallel Sysplex you can include the following servers:</p>  
					<ul> 
						<li> 
							<p>zEC12 and zBC12 servers</p> 
						</li>  
						<li> 
							<p>zEnterprise servers (z196 or z114)</p> 
						</li>  
						<li> 
							<p>z10 EC and z10 BC servers.</p> 
						</li> 
					</ul>  
					<p>The specific zEC12 and zBC12 functions including base support that are used by z/OS depend on the z/OS release. Availability and other restrictions are noted in the "Notes" column. PTFs might be required for many of these functions. See 
						<a href="#znextbef21">Actions you can take before you order a zEC12 or zBC12 server</a> for information about finding the appropriate PTFs.

					<title>General recommendations and considerations for a zEC12 or zBC12 server</title>  
					<description><![CDATA[  
						<p>As you plan your migration to a zEnterprise server, consider the following:</p>  
						<ol> 
							<li> 
								<strong>Relatively few migration actions are new when coming from a z196 or z114 server.</strong>  
								<p>Migration to an IBM zEnterprise EC12 or zEnterprise BC12 server has, as its base, a migration to the z196 or z114 servers. This means that if you are migrating to a zEnterprise server from a z196 or z114 server, and have performed the migration actions associated with the z196 or z114, you have fewer migration actions than if you were migrating from an earlier generation server and have not yet performed the migration actions associated with these servers. It is important to note that you can migrate directly to a zEC12 or zBC12 server without installing the intermediate servers, but you still need to ensure that any migration considerations are satisfied for the servers that you "skipped." To read about z196 and z114 server migration actions, see 
									<a href="#mignext">Migrate to an IBM zEnterprise z196 or z114 server</a>.
								</p> 
							</li>  
							<li> 
								<strong>Support is delivered by service, z/OS features, and web deliverables.</strong>  
								<p>The base support for an zEC12 or zBC12 server is delivered by service (PTFs).</p>  
								<ul> 
									<li> 
										<p>The PSP bucket that contains the required list of PTFs for zBC12 is: Upgrade 2828DEVICE, Subset 2828/ZOS and is identified by the following SMP/E Fix Category IBM.Device.Server.zBC12-2828.</p> 
									</li>  
									<li> 
										<p>The PSP bucket that contains the required list of PTFs for zEC12 is: Upgrade 2827DEVICE, Subset 2827/ZOS</p> 
									</li> 
								</ul>  
								<p>and is identified by the following SMP/E Fix Category IBM.Device.Server.zEC12-2827.</p>  
								<p>For Flash Express support (including dynamic reconfiguration support and optional PLPA/COMMON page data set support), pageable 1 MB Large Page support, and 2 GB Large Page Support, a separate web deliverable for z/OS V1R13 (the z/OS V1R13 RSM Enablement Offering web deliverable) is required. (See "Decide on the steps you will take for your migration to a zEC12 or zBC12 server" in 
									<a href="#znextbef21">Actions you can take before you order a zEC12 or zBC12 server</a> for further information.)
								</p> 
							</li>  
							<li> 
								<strong>Larger coupling facility structure sizes might be necessary.</strong>  
								<p>When you change coupling facility control code (CFCC) levels, your coupling facility structure sizes might change. zEC12 servers that are ordered before September 2013 initially ship with CFCC level 18, zEC12 or zBC12 models ordered after September 2013 initially ship with CFCC level 19. If, as part of your migration to a zEC12 or zBC12 server, you change CFCC levels, you might have larger structure sizes than you did previously. If your CFCC levels are identical, structure sizes are not expected to change when you migrate from a previous server to a newer generation server. In addition, similar to CF Level 17 and later, ensure that the CF LPAR has at least 512MB of storage. CFLEVEL 19 introduces support for storage-class (flash) memory in the CF and Coupling thin interrupt support. CF structures that exploit SCM may require significantly more CF real storage than they did before storage class memory exploitation.</p> 
							</li>  
							<li> 
								<strong>Use the same software level throughout a sysplex.</strong>  
								<p>Having members of a sysplex at the same software level (other than during brief migration periods) is good software management policy.</p> 
							</li>  
							<li> 
								<strong>Migrate hardware and software at different times.</strong>  
								<p>To minimize the amount of change (and therefore risk) that you experience at one time, do not migrate your software release level at the same time that you migrate your hardware.</p> 
							</li>  
							<li> 
								<strong>Update SCRT to latest version.</strong>  
								<p>If you use SCRT, make sure it is at the latest level. This is a requirement for sub-capacity pricing, as well as when you upgrade servers. The latest level of SCRT can be downloaded from the SCRT web site at 
									<a href="http://www.ibm.com/systems/z/resources/swprice/subcap/scrt/">http://www.ibm.com/eserver/zseries/swprice/scrt/</a>.

						<p>This check will be activated if it is not already active. If the check is activated, it will be deactivated at the end of the job, so that it remains in the same state as it was found.</p>  
						<p>If the health check runs with no exception, this step will be marked "Complete" indicating that this migration action requires no more activity.</p>  
						<p>If the health check finds an exception, this step will be marked as "Failed". This tells you that further investigation (and possibly more work) is necessary to complete this migration action. If the step is marked "Failed", you should review the health check output (via any method you use to view health check output, such as SDSF) and correct any situation that you find appropriate. You can then re-run this Workflow step to submit the health check job again, until the health check no longer receives an exception and the step is marked "Complete".</p>

					<title>Restrictions for a zEC12 or zBC12 server</title>  
					<description><![CDATA[  
						<p>Restrictions associated with zEnterprise servers are:</p>  
						<ol> 
							<li> 
								<strong>Functional limitations.</strong>  
								<p>Not all zEC12 or zBC12 functions are available in every z/OS release. See the following for a list of the zEC12 and zBC12 functions available in each z/OS release:</p>  
								<ul> 
									<li> 
										<a href="#znext21__znextfuncbc">Table 31</a> 
									</li>  
									<li> 
										<a href="#znext21__znextbcexp1">Table 32</a> 
									</li> 
								</ul>  
								<p>Some functions have migration or exploitation considerations (see 
									<a href="#znextbef21">Actions you can take before you order a zEC12 or zBC12 server</a> and 
									<a href="#znextaft21a">Migration and exploitation considerations for zEC12 and zBC12 server functions</a>. ) Many functions are enabled or disabled, based on the presence or absence of the required hardware and software. If you wish to position yourself to exploit any new zEC12 or zBC12 functions, you can install the software and hardware in either order; that is, there is no requirement to install either software or hardware first to exploit a specific function. However, because of outage windows and testing considerations, you might want to consider installing all the required software first, then upgrading the hardware and, finally, updating your customization to exploit the new functions.
								</p> 
							</li>  
							<li> 
								<strong>zEC12 and zBC12 servers in a sysplex.</strong>  
								<ul> 
									<li> 
										<p>A Parallel Sysplex that contains an zEC12 or zBC12 server either for a z/OS image or a CF image can only contain other zEC12 or zBC12 servers or zEnterprise z196, z114, z10 EC, or z10 BC servers.</p>  
										<p>If you are running z/OS on any servers earlier than a z10 EC or z10 BC server, you cannot add a zEC12 or zBC12 server to that sysplex; that is, you will not be able to perform rolling IPLs to introduce a zEC12 or zBC12 server if you have any of the earlier servers either as z/OS images or coupling facility images in the sysplex.</p>  
										<p>The earlier servers in the sysplex must be upgraded to System z10 or later to have zEC12 or zBC12 servers supported in the sysplex. If you have any z/OS images or coupling facility images on an earlier server, and you intend to introduce a zEC12 or zBC12 server into that sysplex, you must migrate those images to a System z10 (or later) server before introducing the zEC12 or zBC12 server.</p>  
										<p>If you are currently using ESCON CTCs for GRS ring configurations within a sysplex, consider using XCF signalling in a GRS ring configuration. XCF sysplex signalling is preferred instead of GRS CTC connections.</p> 
									</li>  
									<li> 
										<p>The Integrated Cluster Bus 4 (ICB-4) Coupling Links are not supported on a zEC12 or zBC12 CPC. Use 12x InfiniBand coupling links, which are designed to replace Integrated Cluster Bus 4 (ICB-4), and to complement 1x InfiniBand and ISC-3 on a zEC12 or zBC12 server. InfiniBand coupling can provide significantly improved service times compared to ISC-3s for distances up to 150 meters. You can read about InfiniBand coupling links in 
											<em>IBM System z Connectivity Handbook</em> (SG24-5444).
										</p> 
									</li>  
									<li> 
										<p>The zEC12 or zBC12 server cannot be connected to a Sysplex Timer (9037-002). The Server Time Protocol (STP) feature is the follow-on to the Sysplex Timer. STP is designed to allow multiple servers and coupling facilities to maintain time synchronization with each other without requiring a Sysplex Timer. STP is a hardware eature of the zEC12, zBC12, z196, z114, z10 EC, and z10 BC. To implement STP, see the STP web site and the publications and other resources listed there. The STP web site is at 
											<a href="http://www.ibm.com/systems/z/advantages/pso/stp.html">http://www.ibm.com/systems/z/advantages/pso/stp.html</a> .
										</p>  
										<p>The STP design introduced a concept called Coordinated Timing Network (CTN). A CTN is a collection of servers and coupling facilities that are time-synchronized to a time value called Coordinated Server Time. A CTN can be configured in two ways:</p>  
										<ul> 
											<li> 
												<p>STP-only CTN, which does not require a Sysplex Timer.</p> 
											</li>  
											<li> 
												<p>Mixed-CTN (External Time Reference and STP), which does require a Sysplex Timer.</p>  
												<p>The Sysplex Timer provides the timekeeping information in a Mixed-CTN. Even though the zEC12 or zBC12 servers do not support attachment to a Sysplex Timer, they can participate in a Mixed-CTN that has a z10 server synchronized to the Sysplex Timer. This maintains the capability for enterprises to concurrently migrate from an existing External Time Reference (ETR) to a Mixed-CTN and from a Mixed-CTN to an STP-only CTN.</p> 
											</li> 
										</ul> Note: The zEC12 and zBC12 will be the last high-end servers to support connections to an STP Mixed-CTN. All servers in the network must be configured in STP-only mode. Consider migrating servers that require time synchronization, such as to support a base or Parallel Sysplex, to the Server Time Protocol (STP).
									</li> 
								</ul> 
							</li>  
							<li> 
								<p>For a list of functions on the zEC12 or zBC12 server that are planned to be discontinued on future servers, see 
									<a href="#z2012hw1">Accommodate functions for the zEC12 and zBC12 servers to be discontinued on future servers</a> 
								</p> 
							</li>  
							<li> 
								<strong>Unsupported hardware features.</strong>  
								<p>The following hardware features cannot be ordered and cannot be carried forward from an upgrade on an earlier server to the zEC12 or zBC12 server.</p>  
								<ul> 
									<li> 
										<p>Power® Sequence Controller (PSC).</p> 
									</li>  
									<li> 
										<p>FICON Express. You should begin migrating to FICON Express8S channels.</p> 
									</li>  
									<li> 
										<p>FICON Express2. You should begin migrating to FICON Express8S channels.</p> 
									</li>  
									<li> 
										<p>FICON Express4 4KM LX. You should begin migrating to FICON Express8S channels.</p> 
									</li>  
									<li> 
										<p>OSA Express2. You should begin migrating to OSA-Express4S (GbE LX and SX, 1000BASE-T, 10 GbE LR and SR).</p> 
									</li>  
									<li> 
										<p>ESCON. You should begin migrating to FICON Express8S channels.</p> 
									</li>  
									<li> 
										<p>Dial up modems. The currently available Network Time Protocol (NTP) server option for ETS, as well as Internet time services available using broadband connections, can be used to provide the same degree of accuracy as dial-up time services. You should begin migrating from dial-up modems to broadband for RSF connections</p> 
									</li> 
								</ul>  
								<p> 
									<strong>Carry forward hardware features.</strong> The following hardware features are not orderable on zEC12 or zBC12 servers. If they are installed on your existing server at the time of an upgrade to a zEC12 or zBC12 server, they may be retained or carried forward.
								</p>  
								<ul> 
									<li> 
										<p>ISC-3. You should begin migrating from ISC-3 features (#0217, #0218, #0219) to 12x InfiniBand (#0163 - HCA2-O or #0171- HCA3-O fanout) or 1x InfiniBand (#0168 - HCA2-O LR or #0170 - HCA3-O LR fanout) coupling links.</p> 
									</li>  
									<li> 
										<p>FICON Express4 10KM LX. You should begin migrating to FICON Express8S channels.</p> 
									</li>  
									<li> 
										<p>FICON Express4 SX. You should begin migrating to FICON Express8S channels</p>

						<ol> 
							<li> 
								<strong>Review the sysplex configuration in which the zEC12 or zBC12 server will participate.</strong>  
								<p>See 
									<a href="#znextres21">Restrictions for a zEC12 or zBC12 server</a> for the limitations of using zEC12 or zBC12 servers with certain earlier servers in a Parallel Sysplex.
								</p> 
							</li>  
							<li> 
								<strong>Implement STP (or a Mixed-CTN) timing network.</strong>  
								<p>This action is necessitated because Sysplex Timers (9037-002) are not supported on zEC12 or zBC12 servers.</p> 
							</li>  
							<li> 
								<strong>Migrate from ICB-4 to InfiniBand coupling links.</strong>  
								<p>This action is necessitated because ICB-4 links are not supported on zEC12 or zBC12 servers. If desired, you can take this action after you order a zEC12 or zBC12 server, as you upgrade to the new server.</p> 
							</li>  
							<li> 
								<strong>Migrate from unsupported hardware features to newer technology.</strong>  
								<p>This action is necessitated because FICON Express, FICON Express2, Crypto Express2, and OSA-Express2 10 GbE LR are not supported on zEnterprise servers. See 
									<a href="#znextres21">Restrictions for a zEC12 or zBC12 server</a>, 
									<a href="#at3ruio">Replace unsupported devices</a>, and 
									<a href="#au3ndv">Provide for new device installations</a>.
								</p> 
							</li>  
							<li> 
								<strong>Install the necessary z/OS service, as indicated in PSP buckets.</strong>  
								<ul> 
									<li> 
										<p>For an IBM zEnterprise BC12 CPC, PTFs are identified in the in the 2828DEVICE PSP bucket ( Subset 2828/ZOS).</p> 
									</li>  
									<li> 
										<p>For an IBM zEnterprise EC12 CPC, PTFs are identified in the 2827DEVICE PSP bucket ( Subset 2827/ZOS).</p> 
									</li>  
									<li> 
										<p>For an IBM zEnterprise BladeCenter Extension (zBX) attached to your zEC12 CPC or zBC12 CPC, the PTFs are identified in the 2458DEVICE PSP bucket ( Subset 2458/ZOS).</p> 
									</li> 
								</ul>  
								<p>In each PSP bucket, the content is dependent on the z/OS release you will run on the zEnterprise server. If you reviewed the PSP buckets some time ago, review them again to ensure that any newly identified z/OS service has been installed. To assist you in determining if you have the recommended service (identified in these PSP buckets) installed on your system, you can use the SMP/E REPORT MISSINGFIX command in conjunction with the FIXCAT type of HOLDDATA, as follows:</p>  
								<ol>

										<p>You can also use Service Link's PSP Service Extraction tool.</p> 
									</li>  
									<li> 
										<p>Because the Enhanced PSP Tool (EPSPT) was removed the end of 2010, you can no longer use that tool to identify missing PSP bucket service. You should use SMP/E’s Fix Category support, which is fully integrated into SMP/E procedures and IBM product and service deliverables.</p> 
									</li>

								<strong>Run the CFSIZER tool.</strong>  
								<p>If you are moving your coupling facilities and the coupling facility structures will be on higher CFCC levels than they were previously, run the Coupling Facility Structure Sizer (CFSIZER) tool to find out if you have to increase coupling facility structure sizes.</p>  
								<p>If ordered before September 2013, zEC12 servers initially ship with CFCC Level 18. For zEC12 and zBC12 servers ordered after September 2013, the servers ship with CFCC Level 19; prepare to make the necessary changes as indicated by the tool.</p>  
								<p>You can download the CFSIZER tool at 
									<a href="http://www.ibm.com/systems/support/z/cfsizer/" target="_blank">Coupling Facility sizer (http://www.ibm.com/systems/support/z/cfsizer/)</a>. Also see 
									<a href="#au3cpfl">Update your CFRM policy with coupling facility structure size changes</a>.
								</p> Note: After you make a coupling facility available on the new hardware, you can run the Sizer utility, an authorized z/OS program, to evaluate structure size changes. The Sizer utility is distinct from CFSIZER, and should be run after the new hardware (CFLEVEL) is installed, but before any CF LPAR on the new hardware is populated with structures. You can download the Sizer utility at

								<strong>Decide on the steps you will take for your migration to a zEC12 or zBC12 server.</strong>  
								<p>In addition to the steps listed here in 
									<a href="#znextbef21">Actions you can take before you order a zEC12 or zBC12 server</a>, as a guide, also see 
									<a href="#znextaft21a">Migration and exploitation considerations for zEC12 and zBC12 server functions</a>. Also, note the following web deliverables considerations.
								</p>  
								<p>The level of function provided for cryptographic support differs by z/OS release and the ICSF web deliverable that is installed. Toleration PTFs are also available for some cryptographic web deliverables:</p>  
								<p>Consider the following:</p>  
								<ul> 
									<li> 
										<p>For z/OS V1R13 and z/OS V2R1, if you require the cryptographic enhancements support for CCA (including Export TDES key under AES transport key, Diversified Key Generation CBC, IPEK, RKX key wrapping method, and integration of UDX into CCA), you must install the web deliverable Cryptographic Support for z/OS V1R13-z/OS V2R1 (FMID HCR77A1). You must also perform the required ICSF migration actions.</p> 
									</li>  
									<li> 
										<strong>PTFs for coexistence:</strong>  
										<p>Coexistence PTFs must be installed on older levels of ICSF. To assist in identifying the coexistence service, you can use the following Fix Categories:</p>  
										<ul> 
											<li> 
												<p>IBM.Coexistence.ICSF.z/OS_V1R11-V1R13-HCR7790</p> 
											</li>  
											<li> 
												<p>IBM.Coexistence.ICSF.z/OS_V1R12-V1R13-HCR77A0</p> 
											</li>  
											<li> 
												<p>IBM.Coexistence.ICSF.z/OS_V1R13-V2R1-HCR77A1</p> 
											</li> 
										</ul> 
									</li> 
								</ul>  
								<p>If you plan to use the , then similar to what you might be doing today to enable other z/OS priced features, you must notify IBM that you are starting to use the feature, update the IFAPRDxx PARMLIB member to specify that the z/OS ZEDC software feature is enabled, and follow the z/OS V2R2 documentation to customize the exploiting functions. You should also ensure that all z/OS V1R13 systems that will access zEDC compressed data have the required toleration maintenance installed to enable software decompression.</p> 
							</li>  
							<li> 
								<strong>Review the new mnemonics introduced for the zEC12 or zBC12 server.</strong>  
								<p>The new mnemonics might collide with (be identical to) the names of assembler macro instructions you use or provide. In the event of such collisions, the HLASM’s default opcode table (UNI) will treat specification of these names as instructions when APAR PM49761 and PM86821 are installed. This will probably cause assembler error messages and possibly cause generation of incorrect object code.</p>  
								<p>If you write programs in Assembler Language, you should compare the list provided in 
									<cite>z/Architecture Principles of Operation</cite>, SA22-7832, to the names of assembler macro instructions you use or provide, to identify any such conflicts or collisions that would occur following installation of HLASM APAR PM49761 and PM86821. If a conflict is identified, take one of the following actions:
								</p>  
								<ul> 
									<li> 
										<p>Change the name of your macro instruction.</p> 
									</li>  
									<li> 
										<p>Specify PARM=’...OPTABLE(YOP)...’ (or some other earlier opcode table).</p> 
									</li>  
									<li> 
										<p>Specify a separate ASMAOPT file containing assembler options, such as in the previous method (this method requires no changes to source code or JCL).</p> 
									</li>  
									<li> 
										<p>Add, as the first statement of your source program, *PROCESS OPTABLE(YOP).</p> 
									</li>  
									<li> 
										<p>Specify the PROFILE option either in JCL or the ASMAOPT file, and the specified or default member of the SYSLIB data set is copied into the front of the source program.</p> 
									</li>  
									<li> 
										<p>If you must use both a new instruction and a macro with the same name in an assembly, you can use the following technique (where XXX is a sample mnemonic):</p>  
										<pre> 
<code>Assume the default OPTABLE(UNI) is in effect XXX a,b new instruction PUSH ACONTROL save current optable definition ACONTROL OPTABLE(YOP) switch optable dynamically XXX r,s,t macro invocation POP ACONTROL restore previous definition XXX c,d new instruction</code>
										</pre> 
									</li> 
								</ul>  
								<p>For more information about HLASM opcode table, see 
									<cite>HLASM Programmer's Guide</cite>.
								</p> 
							</li>  
							<li> 
								<strong>Plan for changes to your global resource serialization complex with the zEC12 or zBC12 server.</strong>  
								<p>If you use a global resource serialization ring complex that spans more systems than is part of the sysplex or does not use sysplex signalling for communications within the complex, you need to take migration actions. Instead of using global resource serialization ring, consider using the global resource serialization star configuration in a sysplex. You can take the following actions before you install the zEC12 or zBC12 server:</p>  
								<ul> 
									<li> 
										<p>Migrate to a Parallel Sysplex that uses the recommended global resource serialization star complex.</p> 
									</li>  
									<li> 
										<p>Convert to a basic sysplex that uses XCF sysplex signalling with global resource serialization ring instead of GRS-managed channel-to-channel (CTC) communications.</p> 
									</li> 
								</ul>

					<description><![CDATA[  
						<p> 
							<strong>Consider the number of CPU measurement facility counters for zEC12 or zBC12.</strong> The number of CPU measurement facility counters for zEC12 and zBC12 is increased to 128. More extended counters means that more internal storage is required. Though the structure of the SMF 113 record does not change, the values, interpretations, and frequency of certain sections do change; therefore, current tools using the data must be updated for the zEC12 or zBC12.
						</p>  
						<p>For example, consider the following SMF record field:</p>  
						<ul> 
							<li> 
								<p>SMF113_2_CtrVN2 identifies how to interpret the Crypto and Extended counter sets. As described in 
									<cite>The IBM CPU Measurement Facility Extended Counters Definition for z10 and z196</cite>, SA23-2260, this field is set to 1 (for z10), 2 (for z196 or z114), or 3 (for zEC12 and zBC12).
								</p> 
							</li> 
						</ul> Note: As of z/OS V2R1, if you use the CPU Measurement Facility, IBM recommends that your installation collect SMF 113 subtype 1 and 2 records. IBM also recommends that products process SMF 113 subtype 1 records when available, because that is where future enhancements will be made. If subtype 1 records are not available, products can process subtype 2 records. 
						<p>The following zEC12 and zBC12 functions are available on z/OS V2R1. For PTF information, see the "Notes" for 
							<a href="#znext21__znextbcexp1">Table 32</a>:
						</p>  
						<ol> 
							<li> 
								<strong>CFCC Level 19 Coupling thin interrupt support.</strong>  
								<p>With PTFs CFCC Level 19 provides coupling thin interrupt support that allows a shared logical coupling facility partition to be dispatched by PR/SM if not already dispatched and allows for more timely processing of events to which the CF must respond. It is designed to improve service times for shared engine coupling facilities, and to help improve the response time for asynchronous CF operations. This function requires CFCC Level 19.</p> 
							</li>  
							<li> 
								<strong>Cryptographic Enhancements.</strong>  
								<p>Cryptographic enhancements for z/OS V2R1 on zEC12 and zBC12 server include:</p>  
								<ul> 
									<li> 
										<p>Crypto Express4S CCA enhancements when the PCIe adapter is configured as CCA coprocessor including: Export TDES key under AES transport key, Diversified Key Generation CBC, IPEK, RKX key wrapping method, and Integration of UDX into CCA requires z/OS V2R1 with the Cryptographic Support for z/OS V1R13-z/OS V2R1 Web deliverable (FMID HCR77A1) installed.</p> 
									</li>  
									<li> 
										<p>Crypto Express4S EP11 enhancements when the Crypto Express4S PCIe adapter is configured as an EP11 coprocessor including: (PKCS #11 V2R1 PSS, EP11 Key agreement algorithms, and Offload Generation of Domain Parameters) and requires z/OS V2R1 with the Cryptographic Support for z/OS V1R13-z/OS V2R1 Web deliverable (FMID HCR77A1) to be installed.</p> 
									</li>  
									<li> 
										<p>Crypto Express4S (#0865) exploitation including Enterprise Security PKCS #11-Hardware Security Module (HSM), DUKPT for MAC and Data Encryption, Cipher Text Translate CCA Verb, PKDS/TKDS Constraint Relief, Random Number Cache, FIPS on Demand, and Wrapping Keys with Strong Keys.</p> 
									</li>

									<a href="#znextbef21">Actions you can take before you order a zEC12 or zBC12 server</a> 
								</p> 
							</li>  
							<li> 
								<strong>zEDC capability using zEDC Express.</strong>  
								<p>zEDC provides IBM zEnterprise data compression/decompression capability. For z/OS V2R2, the zEDC software feature must be enabled with your product enablement policy (IFAPRDxx); then follow the z/OS V2R2 documentation to customize the exploiting functions. See 
									<a href="#verify_ifaprd">Verify your IFAPRDxx Product ID is correct for z/OS Version 2</a> 
								</p> 
							</li>  
							<li> 
								<strong>IBM zAware system.</strong>  
								<p>IBM zAware is designed to offer a near real-time, continuous learning, and diagnostics capability intended to help you pinpoint and resolve potential problems quickly enough to minimize impacts to your business. After you order a zEC12 or zBC12 you can prepare to set up an IBM zAware environment by defining the IBM zAware logical partition, defining and using OPERLOG log streams, and network definitions to connect the z/OS LPAR to the zAware LPAR. For more information, see 
									<cite>IBM System z Advanced Workload Analysis Reporter (IBM zAware) Guide</cite>, (SC27-2623) and 
									<cite>z/OS MVS Setting Up a Sysplex</cite>.

										<p>IBM 64-bit SDK for z/OS, Java Technology Edition, V7.0.0 (5655-W44).</p> 
									</li> 
								</ul> Note: Using z/OS V1R13 XL C/C++ compiler and later, specify ARCH(10) to provide the hardware with built-in functions to enable applications to use the Java Transactional Execution Facility.
							</li>  
							<li> 
								<strong>Flash Express (Storage Class Memory or SCM).</strong>  
								<p>This support includes pageable 1 MB Large Page support, dynamic reconfiguration support of SCM, and optional PLPA/COMMON page data set usage. This support requires the Flash Express hardware feature.</p> 
							</li>  
							<li> 
								<strong>2GB Large Page support.</strong>  
								<p>This support includes support for 2 GB large fixed pages.</p> 
							</li>  
							<li> 
								<strong>CFCC Level 19 Flash Express.</strong>  
								<p>This exploitation will provide improved resilience for MQ shared queues. The function requires CFCC Level 19 and is planned to be available in a future update.</p> 
							</li>

								<strong>New z/Architecture instructions: XL C/C++ ARCH(10) and TUNE(10) parameters.</strong>  
								<p>This function provides new zArchitecture instructions.</p> 
							</li>  
							<li> 
								<strong>Shared Memory Communications using RDMA (SMC-R) exploitation.</strong>  
								<p>Shared Memory Communication using RDMA (Remote Direct Memory Access) enables transparent exploitation of RDMA technology for TCP/IP sockets based applications. It requires the 10GbE RoCE Express hardware feature.</p> 
							</li>  
							<li> 
								<strong>24k subchannels per channel (port) for the FICON Express features.</strong>  
								<p>This is planned to help facilitate growth as well as continuing to enable server consolidation. You will be able to define more devices per FICON channel, which includes primary, secondary, and alias devices. This support applies to the FICON Express8S, FICON Express8, and FICON Express4 features when defined as CHPID type FC.</p> 
							</li>  
							<li> 
								<strong>OSA-Express5S.</strong>  
								<p>OSA-Express5S provides a new generation of Ethernet features for use in the PCIe I/O drawer and continues to be supported by the 8 GBps PCIe Gen2 host bus. This support includes: 1000BASE-T Ethernet for copper environments, in addition to 10 Gigabit Ethernet (10 GbE) and Gigabit Ethernet (GbE) for single-mode and multimode fiber optic environment.</p>

						<h5 id="z2012hw1__descriptionz2012hw">Description</h5>  
						<p>The following changes in hardware support could affect your environment. Make the appropriate changes as needed.</p>  
						<ul> 
							<li> 
								<strong>Removal of support for connections to an STP Mixed CTN.</strong>  
								<p>The zEC12 and zBC12 are the last System z servers to support connections to an STP Mixed CTN. This also includes the Sysplex Timer (9037). After the zEC12 and the zBC12, servers that require Time synchronization, such as to support a base or Parallel Sysplex, will Require Server Time Protocol (STP) and all servers in that network must be configured in STP-only mode.</p> 
							</li>  
							<li> 
								<strong>Removal of support for Ethernet half-duplex operation and 10 Mbps link data rate.</strong>  
								<p>The OSA-Express4S 1000BASE-T Ethernet feature is planned to be the last copper Ethernet feature to support half-duplex operation and a 10 Mbps link data rate. The zEC12 and zBC12 servers are planned to be the last IBM System z servers to support half-duplex operation and a 10 Mbps link data rate for copper Ethernet environments. Any future 1000BASE-T Ethernet feature will support full-duplex operation and auto-negotiation to 100 or 1000 Mbps exclusively. This hardware statement of direction is fulfilled with the delivery of OSA-Express5S.</p> 
							</li>  
							<li> 
								<strong>Removal of ISC-3 support on System z.</strong>  
								<p>The zEC12 and zBC12 are planned to be the last System z servers to offer support of the InterSystem Channel-3 (ISC-3) for Parallel Sysplex environments at extended distances. ISC-3 will not be supported on future System z servers as carry forward on an upgrade. Previously, it was announced that the IBM zEnterprise 196 (z196) and IBM zEnterprise 114 (z114) servers were the last to offer ordering of ISC-3. Enterprises should continue migrating from ISC-3 features (#0217, #0218, #0219) to 12x InfiniBand (#0171 - HCA3-O fanout) or 1x InfiniBand (#0170 - HCA3-O LR fanout) coupling links.</p>

							<li> 
								<strong>Removal of OSA-Express3 support on System z.</strong>  
								<p>The zEC12 and zBC12 servers are planned to be the last System z servers to offer support of the Open System Adapter-Express3 (OSA-Express3 #3362, #3363, #3367, #3370, #3371) family of features. OSA-Express3 will not be supported on future System z servers as carry forward on an upgrade. Enterprises should continue migrating from the OSA-Express3 features to the OSA-Express4S (#0404, #0405, #0406, #0407, #0408) and OSA-Express5S features (#0413, #0414, #0415, #0416, #0417).</p> 
							</li>  
							<li> 
								<strong>Removal of FICON Express4 support on System z.</strong>  
								<p>The zEC12 and zBC12 servers are planned to be the last System z servers to offer support of the FICON Express4 features (#3321, #3322). FICON Express4 will not be supported on future System z servers as carry forward on an upgrade. Enterprises should continue migrating from the FICON Express4 features to the FICON Express8S features (#0409, #0410).</p> 
							</li>  
							<li> 
								<strong>Removal of Crypto Express3 support on System z.</strong>  
								<p>The zEC12 and zBC12 servers are planned to be the last System z servers to offer support of the Crypto Express3 features (#0864 and #0871 - zBC12). Crypto Express3 will not be supported on future System z servers as carry forward on an upgrade. Enterprises should continue migrating from the Crypto Express3 features to the Crypto Express4S feature (#0865).</p> 
							</li>  
							<li> 
								<strong>IBM System z Integrated Information Processor (zIIP) and IBM System z Application Assist Processor (zAAP) simplification.</strong>  
								<p>The zEC12 and zBC12 are planned to be the last System z servers to offer support for zAAP specialty engine processors. IBM intends to continue support for running zAAP workloads on zIIP processors ("zAAP on zIIP"). This is intended to help simplify capacity planning and performance management, while still supporting all the currently eligible workloads.</p> 
							</li>  
							<li> 
								<strong>Removal of support for the HCA2-O fanouts for 12x IFB and 1x IFB InfiniBand coupling links.</strong>  
								<p>The zEC12 and zBC12 are planned to be the last System z servers to support the following features as carry forward on an upgrade: HCA2-O fanout for 12x IFB coupling links (#0163) and HCA2-O LR fanout for 1x IFB coupling links (#0168). Enterprises should continue migrating to the HCA3-O fanout for 12x IFB (#0171) and the HCA3-O LR fanout for 1x IFB (#0170).</p> 
							</li>  
							<li> 
								<strong>Removal of support for IEEE 802.3 Ethernet frame types.</strong>  
								<p>The zEC12 and zBC12 are planned to be the last System z servers to support IEEE 802.3 Ethernet frame types. All OSA-Express features supported on future System z servers are planned to support DIX Version 2 (DIX V2) exclusively.</p>

					<title>General recommendations and considerations for a z196 or z114 server</title>  
					<description><![CDATA[  
						<p>As you plan your migration to a zEnterprise server, consider the following:</p>  
						<ol> 
							<li> 
								<strong>Relatively few migration actions are new when coming from a z10 EC or a z10 BC server.</strong>  
								<p>Migration to a zEnterprise server has, as its base, a migration to the z10 EC or z10 BC servers. This means that if you are migrating to a zEnterprise server from a z10 EC or z10 BC server, and have performed the migration actions associated with the z10 EC or z10 BC, you have fewer migration actions than if you were migrating from a server prior to the z10 EC or z10 BC and have not yet performed the migration actions associated with these servers. It is important to note that you can migrate directly to a zEnterprise server without installing the intermediate servers, but you still need to ensure that any migration considerations are satisfied for the servers that you "skipped.".</p> 
							</li>  
							<li> 
								<strong>Support is delivered by service (and FMID web deliverables for ICSF).</strong>  
								<p>The delta (from a z10 EC or z10 BC) support for a zEnterprise server, excluding cryptographic support, is delivered by service (PTFs) on older releases. The cryptographic support for the zEnterprise server continues to be FMIDs, many of which are still available in web deliverables. Different ICSF web deliverables, providing different levels of support, are available for different releases of z/OS. (See "Decide on the steps you will take for your migration to a zEnterprise server" in 
									<a href="#znextbef">Actions you can take before you order a z196 and z114 server</a> for further information.)
								</p> 
							</li>  
							<li> 
								<strong>Larger coupling facility structure sizes might be necessary.</strong>  
								<p>When you change coupling facility control code (CFCC) levels, your coupling facility structure sizes might change. zEnterprise servers initially ship with CFCC level 17. If, as part of your migration to a zEnterprise server, you change CFCC levels (either by placing a coupling facility on the zEnterprise server or by moving the coupling facility to a z10 EC or z10 BC at a later CFCC level), you might have larger structure sizes than you did previously. If your CFCC levels are identical, structure sizes are not expected to change when you migrate from a previous server to a newer generation server.</p> 
							</li>  
							<li> 
								<strong>Use the same software level throughout a sysplex.</strong>  
								<p>Having members of a sysplex at the same software level (other than during brief migration periods) is good software management policy.</p> 
							</li>  
							<li> 
								<strong>Migrate hardware and software at different times.</strong>  
								<p>To minimize the amount of change (and therefore risk) that you experience at one time, do not migrate your software release level at the same time that you migrate your hardware.</p> 
							</li>  
							<li> 
								<strong>Update SCRT to latest version.</strong>  
								<p>If you use SCRT, make sure it is at the latest level. This is a requirement for vWLC, as well as when you upgrade servers. The latest level of SCRT can be downloaded from the SCRT web site at 
									<a href="http://www.ibm.com/systems/z/resources/swprice/subcap/scrt/">http://www.ibm.com/eserver/zseries/swprice/scrt/</a>.

					<instructions>This portion of the Workflow will guide you to submit a job to run an IBM Health Check for z/OS associated with this migration action, 
						<strong>IBMSUP,SUP_HIPERDISPATCHCPUCONFIG</strong>. 
						<p>This check will be activated if it is not already active. If the check is activated, it will be deactivated at the end of the job, so that it remains in the same state as it was found.</p>  
						<p>If the health check runs with no exception, this step will be marked "Complete" indicating that this migration action requires no more activity.</p>  
						<p>If the health check finds an exception, this step will be marked as "Failed". This tells you that further investigation (and possibly more work) is necessary to complete this migration action. If the step is marked "Failed", you should review the health check output (via any method you use to view health check output, such as SDSF) and correct any situation that you find appropriate. You can then re-run this Workflow step to submit the health check job again, until the health check no longer receives an exception and the step is marked "Complete".</p>

					<title>Restrictions for a z196 or z114 server</title>  
					<description><![CDATA[  
						<p>Restrictions associated with zEnterprise servers are:</p>  
						<ol> 
							<li> 
								<strong>Functional limitations.</strong>  
								<p>For a list of the zEnterprise functions that are available in each z/OS release, see 
									<a href="#mignext__zentfunc2">Table 35</a> and 
									<a href="#mignext__zentfexp1">Table 36</a>. Some functions have migration or exploitation considerations (see 
									<a href="#znextexp">Migration and exploitation considerations for z196 and z114 server functions</a>). Many functions are enabled or disabled, based on the presence or absence of the required hardware and software. If you wish to position yourself to exploit any new zEnterprise functions, the software and hardware may be installed in either order. That is, there is no requirement to install either software or hardware first to exploit a specific function. However, due to outage windows and testing considerations, you might want to consider installing all the required software first, then upgrading the hardware and, finally, updating your customization to exploit the new functions.
								</p> 
							</li>  
							<li> 
								<strong>zEnterprise servers in a sysplex.</strong>  
								<ul> 
									<li> 
										<p>zEnterprise servers z196 and z114 are supported in a Parallel Sysplex with other zEnterprise z196 and z114 servers, z10 EC and z10 BC servers, and z9 EC and z9 BC servers. If you introduce zEC12 or zBC12 into a sysplex with z196 or z114, ensure that you have satisfied the zEC12 or zBC12 sysplex restrictions in 
											<a href="#znextres21">Restrictions for a zEC12 or zBC12 server</a>. If you are running z/OS on zSeries z900, z800, z990, or z890 servers, then you cannot add a zEnterprise z196 and z114 server to that sysplex. That is, you will not be able to perform rolling IPLs to introduce a zEnterprise z196 and z114 server if you have any of the earlier (pre-System z) servers either as z/OS images or coupling facility images in the sysplex. The earlier servers in the sysplex must be upgraded to System z9 or later to have zEnterprise z196 and z114 servers supported in the sysplex. If you have any z/OS images or coupling facility images on an earlier server, and you intend to introduce a zEnterprise z196 and z114 server into that sysplex, you must migrate those images to System z9 (or later) server before introducing the zEnterprise z196 and z114 server.
										</p> 
									</li>  
									<li> 
										<p>The Integrated Cluster Bus 4 (ICB-4) Coupling Links are not supported on a zEnterprise CPC. Use 12x InfiniBand coupling links, which are designed to replace Integrated Cluster Bus 4 (ICB-4), and to complement 1x InfiniBand and ISC-3 on a zEnterprise server. InfiniBand coupling can provide significantly improved service times compared to ISC-3s for distances up to 150 meters. You can read about InfiniBand coupling links in 
											<em>IBM System z Connectivity Handbook</em> (SG24-5444).
										</p> 
									</li>  
									<li> 
										<p>The zEnterprise servers cannot be connected to a Sysplex Timer (9037-002). The Server Time Protocol (STP) feature is the follow-on to the Sysplex Timer. STP is designed to allow multiple servers and coupling facilities to maintain time synchronization with each other without requiring a Sysplex Timer. STP is a hardware feature of the zEnterprise, z10 EC, z10 BC, z9 EC, z9 BC, z990, and z890 servers. To implement STP, see the STP web site and the publications and other resources listed there. The STP web site is at 
											<a href="http://www.ibm.com/systems/z/advantages/pso/stp.html">http://www.ibm.com/systems/z/advantages/pso/stp.html</a> .
										</p>  
										<p>The STP design introduced a concept called Coordinated Timing Network (CTN). A CTN is a collection of servers and coupling facilities that are time-synchronized to a time value called Coordinated Server Time. A CTN can be configured in two ways:</p>  
										<ul> 
											<li> 
												<p>STP-only CTN, which does not require a Sysplex Timer.</p> 
											</li>  
											<li> 
												<p>Mixed-CTN (External Time Reference and STP), which does require a Sysplex Timer.</p>  
												<p>The Sysplex Timer provides the timekeeping information in a Mixed-CTN. Even though the zEnterprise servers do not support attachment to a Sysplex Timer, they can participate in a Mixed-CTN that has either a z10 or z9 server synchronized to the Sysplex Timer. This maintains the capability for enterprises to concurrently migrate from an existing External Time Reference (ETR) to a Mixed-CTN and from a Mixed-CTN to an STP-only CTN.</p> 
											</li> 
										</ul> 
									</li> 
								</ul> 
							</li>  
							<li> 
								<strong>Unsupported hardware features.</strong>  
								<p>The following hardware features that were available on System z10 (and some earlier) servers cannot be ordered (and cannot be carried forward on an upgrade to a z114) server with zEnterprise servers. You must migrate to the newer technology available on zEnterprise servers.</p>  
								<ul>

									</li>  
									<li> 
										<p>FICON Express2</p>

										<p>Crypto Express2</p> 
									</li>  
									<li> 
										<p>OSA-Express2 10 GbE LR</p> 
									</li> 
								</ul>  
								<p>The following hardware features are not orderable on z196 servers. If they are installed on your existing server at the time of an upgrade to a z196 server, they may be retained.</p>  
								<ul> 
									<li> 
										<p>FICON Express4 10KM LX</p>

					<title>Actions you can take before you order a z196 and z114 server</title>  
					<description><![CDATA[  
						<p>You can perform the following migration actions before you order or install a z196 or z114 server:</p>  
						<ol> 
							<li> 
								<strong>Review the sysplex configuration in which the z196 or z114 server will participate.</strong>  
								<p>See 
									<a href="#znextres">Restrictions for a z196 or z114 server</a> for a description of the limitations when using IBM zEnterprise EC12 servers with zEnterprise z196 or z114 servers or with other earlier servers in a Parallel Sysplex.
								</p> 
							</li>  
							<li> 
								<strong>Implement STP (or a Mixed-CTN) timing network.</strong>  
								<p>This action is needed because Sysplex Timers (9037-002) are not supported on zEnterprise servers.</p> 
							</li>  
							<li> 
								<strong>Migrate from ICB-4 to InfiniBand coupling links.</strong>  
								<p>This action is needed because ICB-4 links are not supported on zEnterprise servers. If desired, you can take this action after you order a zEnterprise server, as you upgrade to the new server.</p> 
							</li>  
							<li> 
								<strong>Migrate from unsupported hardware features to newer technology.</strong>  
								<p>This action is needed because FICON Express, FICON Express2, Crypto Express2, and OSA-Express2 10 GbE LR are not supported on zEnterprise servers.</p> 
							</li>  
							<li> 
								<strong>Install the necessary z/OS service, as indicated in PSP buckets.</strong>  
								<p>For a zEnterprise 196 CPC, PTFs are identified in the 2817DEVICE PSP bucket (Subset 2817/ZOS). For a zEnterprise 114 CPC, PTFs are identified in the 2818DEVICE PSP bucket (Subset 2818/ZOS). For an IBM zEnterprise BladeCenter Extension (zBX) attached to your z196 CPC or to your z114 CPC, the PTFs are identified in the 2458DEVICE PSP bucket (Subset 2458/ZOS). In each PSP bucket, the content is dependent on the z/OS release you will run on the zEnterprise server. If you reviewed the PSP buckets some time ago, review them again to ensure that any newly identified z/OS service has been installed. To assist you in determining if you have the recommended service (identified in these PSP buckets) installed on your system, you can use the SMP/E REPORT MISSINGFIX command in conjunction with the FIXCAT type of HOLDDATA, as follows:</p>  
								<ol> 
									<li> 
										<p>Acquire and RECEIVE the latest HOLDDATA onto your z/OS system(s). Use your normal service acquisition portals or download the two (2) year HOLDDATA directly from 
											<a href="http://service.software.ibm.com/holdata/390holddata.html" target="_blank">http://service.software.ibm.com/holdata/390holddata.html</a>. Ensure you select 
											<strong>Full</strong> from the Download NOW column (last 730 days) to receive the FIXCAT HOLDDATA, as the other files do not contain FIXCAT HOLDDATA.
										</p> 
									</li>  
									<li> 
										<p>Run the SMP/E REPORT MISSINGFIX command on your z/OS systems and specify one or more of the following Fix Categories (FIXCAT):</p>  
										<ul> 
											<li> 
												<p>IBM.Device.Server.z196-2817</p> 
											</li>  
											<li> 
												<p>IBM.Device.Server.z196-2817.ParallelSysplexInfiniBandCoupling</p> 
											</li>  
											<li> 
												<p>IBM.Device.Server.z196-2817.ServerTimeProtocol</p> 
											</li>  
											<li> 
												<p>IBM.Device.Server.z196-2817.zHighPerformanceFICON</p> 
											</li>  
											<li> 
												<p>IBM.Device.Server.z114-2818</p> 
											</li>  
											<li> 
												<p>IBM.Device.Server.z114-2818.ParallelSysplexInfiniBandCoupling</p> 
											</li>  
											<li> 
												<p>IBM.Device.Server.z114-2818.ServerTimeProtocol</p> 
											</li>  
											<li> 
												<p>IBM.Device.Server.z114-2818.zHighPerformanceFICON</p> 
											</li>  
											<li> 
												<p>IBM.Device.Server.z114-2818.UnifiedResourceManager</p> 
											</li>  
											<li> 
												<p>IBM.Device.Server.zBX-2458</p> 
											</li>  
											<li> 
												<p>IBM.Device.Server.zBX-2458.ISAOPT</p> 
											</li> 
										</ul>  
										<p>The report will identify any missing coexistence and fallback PTFs for that system. For complete information about the REPORT MISSINGFIX command, see 
											<cite>SMP/E for z/OS Commands</cite>.
										</p> 
									</li>  
									<li> 
										<p>Periodically, you might want to acquire the latest HOLDDATA and rerun the REPORT MISSINGFIX command to find out if there are any new PTFs recommended for the zEnterprise servers.</p> 
									</li> 
								</ol> Note: 
								<ol> 
									<li> 
										<p>You can also use the Service Link PSP Service Extraction tool.</p> 
									</li>  
									<li> 
										<p>Because the Enhanced PSP Tool (EPSPT) was removed the end of 2010, you can no longer use that tool to identify missing PSP bucket service. You should use SMP/E’s Fix Category support, which is fully integrated into SMP/E procedures and IBM product and service deliverables.</p> 
									</li> 
								</ol> 
							</li>  
							<li> 
								<strong>Run the CFSIZER and Sizer tools.</strong>  
								<p>If you are moving your coupling facilities and the coupling facility structures will be on higher CFCC levels than they were previously, run the Coupling Facility Structure Sizer (CFSIZER) tool to find out if you have to increase coupling facility structure sizes. Run the Sizer utility, an authorized z/OS program that you can download, to evaluate structure size changes. The Sizer utility is distinct from CFSizer, and should be run after the new hardware (CFLEVEL) is installed but before any CF LPAR on the new hardware is populated with structures. z196 or z114 servers are initially shipped with CFCC Level 17; prepare to make the necessary changes as indicated by the tool. You can find the CFSIZER tool at 
									<a href="http://www.ibm.com/systems/support/z/cfsizer/" target="_blank">Coupling Facility sizer (http://www.ibm.com/systems/support/z/cfsizer/)</a>.
								</p> 
							</li>  
							<li> 
								<strong>Plan for the fixed HSA enhancement on a zEnterprise server.</strong>  
								<p>On zEnterprise (and z10) servers, preplanning requirements are minimized by offering a fixed HSA and introduction of the ability to seamlessly include such events as creation of LPARs, inclusion of logical subsystems, changing logical processor definitions in an LPAR, and introduction of cryptography into an LPAR.</p> 
							</li>  
							<li> 
								<strong>Decide on the steps to take for your migration to a z196 or z114 server.</strong>  
								<p>As a guide, see 
									<a href="#znxtrmss">Recommended migration steps for a z196 and z114 server</a>. Also, note the following:
								</p>  
								<ul> 
									<li> 
										<p>You should compare the cryptographic support you currently have installed with the support required for the functions you plan to use on the zEnterprise z196 and z114 server. Several cryptographic support web deliverables have been made available for various z/OS releases. The newer cryptographic web deliverables include the previous function (when applicable) for that particular z/OS level. Note that you can use the newer cryptographic web deliverables on servers before the zEnterprise servers, that is, on z10 and z9 (or earlier) servers.</p> 
									</li>  
									<li> 
										<p>The level of function provided for cryptographic support differs by z/OS release and the ICSF web deliverable that is installed. For z/OS V1R12 and later, exploitation of zEnterprise z196 and z114 cryptographic support is provided by Cryptographic Support for z/OS V1R11-V1R13 (FMID HCR7790) web deliverable. Note that this level of ICSF is not integrated in z/OS V1R13 and must be downloaded and installed even after ordering a z/OS V1R13 ServerPac.</p> 
									</li> 
								</ul> 
							</li>  
							<li> 
								<strong>Review the new mnemonics introduced for the z196 or z114 server.</strong>  
								<p>The new mnemonics might collide with (be identical to) the names of assembler macro instructions you use or provide. In the event of such collisions, the HLASM’s default opcode table (UNI) will treat specification of these names as instructions when APAR PK97799 is installed. This will probably cause assembler error messages and possibly cause generation of incorrect object code. For a tool to help in identifying mnemonic conflicts, see 
									<cite>Techdoc PRS5289</cite> at the 
									<a href="http://www-03.ibm.com/support/techdocs/atsmastr.nsf/WebIndex/PRS5289" target="_blank">IBM Techdocs website</a>.
								</p>  
								<p>If you write programs in assembler language, you should compare the list provided in 
									<cite>z/Architecture Principles of Operation</cite>, SA22-7832, to the names of assembler macro instructions you use or provide, to identify any such conflicts or collisions that would occur following installation of HLASM APAR PK97799. If a conflict is identified, take one of the following actions:
								</p>  
								<ul> 
									<li> 
										<p>Change the name of your macro instruction.</p> 
									</li>  
									<li> 
										<p>Specify PARM=’...OPTABLE(YOP)...’ (or some other earlier opcode table).</p> 
									</li>  
									<li> 
										<p>Specify a separate ASMAOPT file containing assembler options, such as in the previous method (this method requires no changes to source code or JCL).</p> 
									</li>  
									<li> 
										<p>Add, as the first statement of your source program, *PROCESS OPTABLE(YOP).</p> 
									</li>  
									<li> 
										<p>Specify the PROFILE option either in JCL or the ASMAOPT file, and the specified or default member of the SYSLIB data set is copied into the front of the source program.</p> 
									</li>  
									<li> 
										<p>If you must use both a new instruction and a macro with the same name in an assembly, you can use the following technique (where XXX is a sample mnemonic):</p>  
										<pre> 
<code>Assume the default OPTABLE(UNI) is in effect XXX a,b new instruction PUSH ACONTROL save current optable definition ACONTROL OPTABLE(YOP) switch optable dynamically XXX r,s,t macro invocation POP ACONTROL restore previous definition XXX c,d new instruction</code>
										</pre> 
									</li> 
								</ul>

									<cite>HLASM Programmer's Guide</cite>.

					<title>Recommended migration steps for a z196 and z114 server</title>  
					<description><![CDATA[  
						<p>This topic suggests the steps for migrating your same z/OS release level from your current server to a zEnterprise server. The steps are based on the assumption that you want to minimize the amount of change (and therefore risk) and the amount of work required to perform the migration.</p>  
						<p>The migration steps follow:</p>  
						<ol> 
							<li> 
								<p>If necessary, migrate to an STP-only or Mixed-CTN timing network.</p> 
							</li>  
							<li> 
								<p>Ensure that you have installed the z196, z114, z10 EC (or z10 BC), and z9 EC (or z9 BC) required service, as indicated in the respective PSP buckets. See "Install the necessary z/OS service, as indicated in PSP buckets" in 
									<a href="#znextbef">Actions you can take before you order a z196 and z114 server</a> for information about how to identify, acquire, and install any missing required service.

							<li> 
								<p>Ensure you have the required service, and any required ICSF web deliverable installed for the cryptographic functions that you have decided to use.</p> 
							</li>  
							<li> 
								<p>Upgrade your hardware to zEnterprise system. If necessary convert to InfiniBand Coupling Links from ICB-4 links.</p>

					<title>Migration and exploitation considerations for z196 and z114 server functions</title>  
					<description><![CDATA[  
						<p>This topic provides migration and exploitation considerations for zEnterprise server functions.</p>  
						<p>The following zEnterprise functions are available on z/OS V1R12 and later releases:</p>  
						<ul> 
							<li> 
								<strong>InfiniBand Coupling.</strong>  
								<p>Each system can use, or not use, InfiniBand coupling links independently of what other systems are doing, and do so in conjunction with other link types. InfiniBand Coupling connectivity can only be performed with other systems that also support InfiniBand Coupling.</p> 
							</li>  
							<li> 
								<strong>HiperDispatch.</strong>  
								<p>The existing HIPERDISPATCH=YESNO parameter in IEAOPT xx member of parmlib, and on the SET OPT= xx command to control whether HiperDispatch is enabled or disabled for the system, can be changed dynamically.</p>  
								<p>A WLM goal adjustment might be required when using HiperDispatch. Review and update your WLM policies as necessary.</p> 
							</li>  
							<li> 
								<strong>HiperDispatch cache and affinity node changes.</strong>  
								<p>This function is enhanced to exploit zEnterprise architecture and now allows three physical CPs from same chip to form affinity node. A z10 uses HiperDispatch book cache support and four physical CPs from same book.</p>  
								<p>To realize the benefits of HiperDispatch, z/OS has been changed to force HiperDispatch=YES for LPARs with greater than 64 CPUs. On LPARs with greater than 64 CPUs defined on a zEnterprise server with IEAOPT xx specifying HIPERDISPATCH=NO during IPL (or SET OPT= xx after IPL), the system generates a message but continues to run with HIPERDISPATCH=YES. The new message is IRA865I HIPERDISPATCH=YES FORCED DUE TO GREATER THAN 64 LPS DEFINED.</p>  
								<p>On LPARs in which HIPERDISPATCH=NO is specified with less than 64 CPUs, you can dynamically add more CPUs and continue to run in HIPERDISPATCH=NO. However, you may see the new message ISN012E HIPERDISPATCH MUST BE ENABLED TO CONFIGURE CPU IDS GREATER THAN 3F ONLINE.</p>  
								<p>Any attempt to configure CPUs greater than 64 CPUs online in HIPERDISPATCH=NO will be rejected with message IEE241I CPU(x) NOT RECONFIGURED ONLINE - REQUIRES HIPERDISPATCH ENABLED.</p>  
								<p>An LPAR with greater than 64 CPUs that dynamically changed to HIPERDISPATCH=YES cannot go back to HIPERDISPATCH=NO. It will be treated as if it was IPLed with HIPERDISPATCH=YES after HIPERDISPATCH=YES is activated.</p>  
								<p>To assist with warning when you are getting close to 64 CPUs and running with HIPERDISPATCH=NO, the IBM Health Checker for z/OS check, SUP_HiperDispatchCPUConfig, was added in z/OS V1R12. The check always succeeds for LPAR in HIPERDISPATCH=YES (all CPU configurations supported). When an LPAR is running with HIPERDISPATCH=NO, the check raises an exception when the number of CPUs is close to forcing the LPAR to IPL with HIPERDISPATCH=YES. The CPUSLEFTB4NEEDHD parameter indicates the minimum number of CPUs that can be installed and activated on an LPAR running in HIPERDISPATCH=NO. When CPUSLEFTB4NEEDHD=0, the check always succeeds. The default is 8, with values 0-63 accepted. To assist with warning when you are getting close to 64 CPUs and running with HIPERDISPATCH=NO, use IBM Health Checker for z/OS check, SUP_HiperDispatchCPUConfig. Possible IBM Health Checker for z/OS messages:</p>  
								<ul> 
									<li> 
										<p>IEAVEH080I CPU configuration supported with HiperDispatch curstate</p> 
									</li>  
									<li> 
										<p>IEAVEH081E CPU configuration supported with HiperDispatch disabled. numcpus more CPU(s) can be added with HiperDispatch disabled.</p> 
									</li> 
								</ul> 
							</li>  
							<li> 
								<strong>CFCC Level 17.</strong>  
								<p>If you are moving your coupling facilities and the coupling facility structures will be on higher CFCC levels than they were previously, run the Coupling Facility Structure Sizer (CFSIZER) tool to find out if you have to increase coupling facility structure sizes. zEnterprise servers initially shipped with CFCC Level 17. Prepare to make the necessary changes as indicated by the tool. You can find the CFSIZER tool at 
									<a href="http://www.ibm.com/systems/support/z/cfsizer/" target="_blank">Coupling Facility sizer (http://www.ibm.com/systems/support/z/cfsizer/)</a>.
								</p> Note: The PTFs to support CFCC Level 17 have coexistence (or sysplex preconditioning) PTFs that require installation throughout your sysplex before implementing CFCC Level 17.
							</li>  
							<li> 
								<strong>Third Subchannel Set.</strong>  
								<p>You now have the ability to extend the amount of addressable storage capacity to help facilitate storage growth with the introduction of a third subchannel set, an additional 64K devices, to help complement other functions such as "large" or extended addressing volumes and HyperPAV. This may also help to facilitate consistent device address definitions, simplifying addressing schemes for congruous devices.</p>  
								<p>The first subchannel set (SS 0) allows definitions of any type of device, such as bases, aliases, secondaries, and those other than disk that do not implement the concept of associated aliases or secondaries. The second and third subchannel sets (SS1 and SS2) can now both be designated for use for disk alias devices (of both primary and secondary devices), or Metro Mirror secondary devices only. The third subchannel set applies ESCON, FICON and zHPF protocols. Definitions for the third subchannel set are similar to those for the second subchannel set and can be made with HCD.</p>  
								<p>The IODF statement of LOADxx allows users to indicate which devices to use during IPL (that is, devices that are connected to subchannel set 0, 1 or 2). This specification is done on the IODF statement (column 36). For more information, see 
									<cite>z/OS MVS Initialization and Tuning Reference</cite>.
								</p> 
							</li>  
							<li> 
								<strong>IPL from alternate subchannel set.</strong>  
								<p>This function allows you to IPL from subchannel set 1 (SS1) or subchannel set 2 (SS2), in addition to subchannel set 0. Devices used early during IPL processing can now be accessed using subchannel set 1 or subchannel set 2. This is intended to allow users of Metro Mirror (PPRC) secondary devices defined using the same device number and a new device type in an alternate subchannel set to be used for IPL, IODF, and standalone dump volumes when needed. IPL from an alternate subchannel set is supported by z/OS V1R13 and later, and applies to the FICON and zHPF protocols (CHPID type FC).</p>  
								<p>To IPL from an alternate subchannel set, you need to specify a 5 digit load address on the LPAR image profile on the HMC, and have the appropriate specification on the IODF statement column 36 in LOAD xx . This capability is available for z196 as of September 2011 (GA2) and later and for z114. z114 supports only SS0 and SS1, so you cannot IPL from subchannel set 2 (SS2).</p> Tip: Column 36 of the IODF statement in LOADxx is the subchannel set indicator. This field indicates which subchannel set should be used as the primary volume during IPL. You can now specify an asterisk "*" for this value in the field to indicate that the subchannel set of the IPL volume should be used as the subchannel set for the primary volumes. APAR OA35135 for z/OS V1R11 and V1R12 added this new function to specify an asterisk '*' in column 36 of the IODF statement in LOADxx parmlib member.

							<li> 
								<strong>IBM zEnterprise Unified Resource Manager for enabling management and virtualization of heterogeneous workloads.</strong>  
								<p>The Unified Resource Manager manages the deployment of heterogeneous hardware resources based on individual workload requirements:</p>  
								<ul> 
									<li> 
										<p>Performance management</p> 
									</li>  
									<li> 
										<p>Integrated private data network</p> 
									</li> 
								</ul>  
								<p>See 
									<em>System z Ensemble Planning and Configuration Guide</em> (GC27-2608) for the steps that are required.
								</p> 
							</li>  
							<li> 
								<strong>Power save mode.</strong>  
								<p>This function is available only on z196 servers. There is a new SMFPRMxx parmlib option, MAXEVENTINTRECS, that allows governing the number of event interval records to be collected when the processor capacity changes. The default is zero. This function is available only on z196 servers; it is not available on z114 servers.</p>  
								<p>If you are using the CPU Measurement Facility (Hardware Instrumentation Services), there is a new parameter on the MODIFY hisproc command. You can use this parameter, STATECHANGE, to override the default action to take when a CPU speed change is detected within the HIS component.</p> 
							</li>  
							<li> 
								<strong>zHPF performance improvements for FICON Express8S.</strong>  
								<p>FICON Express8S contains a new IBM ASIC which is designed to support the 8 Gbps (gigabytes per second) PCIe interface to the PCIe I/O drawer and increased start I/Os. In addition, a hardware data router has been added in support of the zHPF and FCP protocols for path length reduction and increased throughput. FICON Express8S supports a link data rate of 2, 4, or 8 Gbps autonegotiated. With these changes FICON Express8S, when supporting the zHPF or FCP protocols, has been designed to achieve full duplex line speed (8 Gbps) in each direction. The performance of the FICON protocol remains unchanged from FICON Express8. To use zHPF performance improvements for FICON Express8S, you need to specify the ZHPF=YES NO parameter in the IECIOSxx member of PARMLIB and use FICON Express8S.</p> 
							</li>  
							<li> 
								<strong>Additional Crypto exploitation.</strong>  
								<p>The following enhancements have been added to the Common Cryptographic Architecture support, which is used in the Crypto Express3 feature when it is configured as a coprocessor:</p>  
								<ul> 
									<li> 
										<p>ANSI X9.8 Pin security</p> 
									</li>  
									<li> 
										<p>Enhanced Common Cryptographic Architecture (CCA), 64bit, CP Assist for Cryptographic Function (CPACF) enhancements</p> 
									</li>  
									<li> 
										<p>Secure Keyed-Hash Message Authentication Code (HMAC)</p> 
									</li>  
									<li> 
										<p>CKDS Constraint Relief</p> 
									</li>  
									<li> 
										<p>PCI Audit, Elliptical Curve Cryptography (ECC) Digital Signature Algorithm</p> 
									</li>  
									<li> 
										<p>CBC Key Wrap</p> 
									</li>  
									<li> 
										<p>PKA RSA OEAP with SHA-256</p> 
									</li>  
									<li> 
										<p>Expanded support for AES algorithm</p> 
									</li>  
									<li> 
										<p>Enhanced ANSI TR-31 Secure Key Exchange</p> 
									</li>  
									<li> 
										<p>PIN block decimalization table protection</p> 
									</li>  
									<li> 
										<p>PKA RSA OAEP with SHA-256 algorithm, additional Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) functions.</p> 
									</li> 
								</ul> 
							</li>  
							<li> 
								<strong>z/OS Discovery and AutoConfiguration (zDAC) for FICON channels.</strong>  
								<p>With a zEnterprise CPC and z/OS, a new function, z/OS Discovery and AutoConfiguration (zDAC), is designed to automatically perform a number of I/O configuration definition tasks for new and changed disk and tape controllers through FICON channels. Starting with z/OS V2R1 FICON point-to-point paths are also included in the discovery process whether or not they are connected to a switch or director when attached to a FICON channel. When new controllers are added to an I/O configuration, or changes are made to existing controllers, the system is designed to discover them and propose configuration changes based on a policy you define in the Hardware Configuration Definition (HCD) dialog. Your policy can include preferences for availability and bandwidth including parallel access volume (PAV) definitions, control unit numbers, and device number ranges.</p>  
								<p>zDAC is designed to perform discovery for all systems in a sysplex that support the function. The proposed configuration will incorporate the current contents of the I/O definition file (IODF) with additions for newly installed and changed control units and devices. zDAC is designed to help simplify I/O configuration on CPC running z/OS and reduce complexity and setup time. zDAC applies to all FICON features supported on zEnterprise servers when configured as CHPID type FC, and is supported by z/OS V1R12 and later.</p>  
								<p>To use zDAC, you must first establish a policy for the discovery operation. This is done through HCD or HCM. You can limit the scope of the discovery, limit the proposal information, indicate the desired number of paths to discovered logical control units, and indicate the method used for device and control unit numbering. After controllers and devices are discovered, you can select which controllers to be defined and accept or override the proposed values for control units and devices.</p> 
							</li>  
							<li> 
								<strong>OSA-Express3 and OSA-Express4S Inbound Workload Queuing (IWQ).</strong>  
								<p>Inbound workload queuing for Enterprise Extender is supported by the OSA-Express4S and OSA-Express3 features when defined as CHPID types OSD or OSX. It is exclusive to the z196 and z114 servers, and is supported by z/OS and by z/VM for guest exploitation. OSA-Express3 introduces inbound workload queuing (IWQ), which creates multiple input queues and allows OSA to differentiate workloads "off the wire" and then assign work to a specific input queue (per device) to z/OS. With each input queue representing a unique type of workload, each having unique service and processing requirements, the IWQ function allows z/OS to preassign the appropriate processing resources for each input queue. This approach allows multiple concurrent z/OS processing threads to then process each unique input queue (workload), avoiding traditional resource contention. In a heavily mixed workload environment, this "off the wire" network traffic separation provided by OSA-Express3 IWQ reduces the conventional z/OS processing required to identify and separate unique workloads, which results in improved overall system performance and scalability. The types of z/OS workloads that are identified and assigned to unique input queues are:</p>  
								<ul> 
									<li> 
										<p>z/OS Sysplex Distributor traffic: Network traffic that is associated with a distributed Virtual Internet Protocol Address (VIPA) is assigned a unique input queue allowing the Sysplex Distributor traffic to be immediately distributed to the target host.</p> 
									</li>  
									<li> 
										<p>z/OS bulk data traffic: Network traffic that is dynamically associated with a streaming (bulk data) TCP connection is assigned to a unique input queue allowing the bulk data processing to be assigned the appropriate resources and isolated from critical interactive workloads.</p> 
									</li> 
								</ul>  
								<p>IWQ is supported on zEnterprise CPC and System z10, and is exclusive to OSA-Express3 CHPID types OSD and OSX (exclusive to zEnterprise CPC). There are some Communications Server configuration settings required to enable multiple inbound data queues.</p> 
							</li>  
							<li> 
								<strong>Display OSAINFO.</strong>  
								<p>OSA-Express3 introduces the capability for the operating system to directly query and display the current OSA configuration information (similar to OSA/SF). z/OS exploits this new OSA capability by introducing a new TCP/IP operator command, Display OSAINFO. Display OSAINFO allows the operator to monitor and verify the current OSA configuration, which helps to improve the overall management, serviceability, and usability of OSA-Express3. The Display OSAINFO command is exclusive to OSA-Express3 CHPID types OSD, OSM, and OSX (on z196, z114, and z10 servers).</p> 
							</li>  
							<li> 
								<strong>XL C/C++ ARCH(9) and TUNE(9) options.</strong>  
								<p>The ARCHITECTURE XL C/C++ compiler option selects the minimum level of machine architecture on which your program can run. Certain features provided by the compiler require a minimum architecture level. ARCH(9) exploits instructions available on zEnterprise servers. For more information, refer to the ARCHITECTURE compiler option in 
									<cite>z/OS XL C/C++ User's Guide</cite>. The TUNE compiler option allows you to optimize your application for specific machine architecture. The TUNE level has to be at the ARCH level, at a minimum. If the TUNE level is earlier than the specified ARCH level, the compiler forces TUNE to match the ARCH level, or uses the default TUNE level, whichever is greater. For more information about the ARCHITECTURE and TUNE compiler options refer to 
									<cite>z/OS XL C/C++ User's Guide</cite>.
								</p>  
								<p> 
									<strong>Exploitation restriction.</strong> When programs exploit the ARCH(9) or TUNE(9) option, those programs can only run on zEnterprise servers, or an operation exception will occur. This is a consideration for programs that will run on different server levels (z10 and z9 servers) during development, test, and production, as well as during fallback or disaster recovery.
								</p> 
							</li> 
						</ul>  
						<p>The following zEnterprise functions are only available on z/OS V1R13 and later releases. See 
							<cite>z/OS Introduction and Release Guide</cite> for restrictions, dependencies, and steps to take to use these new hardware functions:
						</p>  
						<ul> 
							<li> 
								<strong>OSA-Express4S checksum offload for LPAR-to-LPAR traffic for IPv4 and IPv6 packets (CHPID type OSD).</strong>  
								<p>Checksum offload for LPAR-to-LPAR traffic is included in the OSA-Express4S design. The checksum function has been moved from the PCIe adapter to the OSA-Express4S hardware to help reduce CPU utilization.</p> 
							</li>  
							<li> 
								<strong>OSA-Express4S large send for IPv6 packets (CHPID types OSD and OSX).</strong>  
								<p>Large send (also referred to as TCP segmentation offload) is designed to improve performance by offloading outbound TCP segmentation processing from the host to an OSA-Express4S feature by employing a more efficient memory transfer into OSA-Express4. Large send support for IPv6 packets applies to the OSA-Express4S features (CHPID type OSD and OSX), and is exclusive to z196 and z114.</p> 
							</li>  
							<li> 
								<strong>Inbound workload queuing for Enterprise Extender.</strong>  
								<p>Inbound workload queuing (IWQ) for the OSA-Express4S features has been enhanced to differentiate and separate inbound Enterprise Extender traffic to a new input queue. The Enterprise Extender separation and processing associated with the Enterprise Extender input queue provides improved scalability and performance for Enterprise Extender.</p>

					<title>Accommodate functions for the z196 and z114 servers to be discontinued on future servers</title>  
					<description><![CDATA[  
						<h5 id="znextsod1__descriptionz196">Description</h5>  
						<p>The following changes in hardware support could affect your environment. Make the appropriate changes as needed.</p>  
						<ul> 
							<li> 
								<strong>ISC-3 features (#0217, #0218, #0219).</strong>  
								<p>The IBM zEnterprise zEC12 is planned to be the last high-end System z server to offer support of the InterSystem Channel-3 (ISC-3) for Parallel Sysplex environments at extended distances. ISC-3 will not be supported on future high-end System z servers as carry forward on an upgrade. Previously it was announced that the IBM zEnterprise 196 (z196) and IBM zEnterprise 114 (z114) servers were the last to offer ordering of ISC-3. Enterprises should continue migrating from ISC-3 features (#0217, #0218, #0219) to 12x InfiniBand (#0171 - HCA3-O fanout) or 1x InfiniBand (#0170 - HCA3-O LR fanout) coupling links.</p> 
							</li>  
							<li> 
								<strong>Power Sequence Controller (PSC feature #6501).</strong>  
								<p>The last zEnterprise server machines to support PSC (feature #6501) are the z196 (machine type 2817) and z114 (machine type 2818). PSC features cannot be ordered and cannot be carried forward on an upgrade to the zEC12 server. The optional PSC feature is used to turn on or off specific control units from the central processor complex (CPC).</p> 
							</li>  
							<li> 
								<strong>ESCON channels.</strong>  
								<p>The last zEnterprise server to support ESCON channels are the z196 (machine type 2817) and z114 (machine type 2818). In addition, ESCON channels cannot be carried forward on an upgrade to the zEC12 server. This applies to channel path identifier (CHPID) types CNC, CTC, CVC, and CBY and to feature numbers 2323 and 2324. You should be migrating from ESCON to FICON and eliminating ESCON channels from the mainframe wherever possible. Alternate solutions are available for connectivity to ESCON devices. IBM Global Technology Services offers an ESCON to FICON migration solution, Offering ID #6948-97D, to help facilitate migration from ESCON to FICON. This offering can help you to simplify and manage a single physical and operational environment.</p> 
							</li>  
							<li> 
								<strong>OSA-Express2 features.</strong>  
								<p>The z196 is the last high-end server, and the z114 is the last mid-range server, to support OSA-Express2 features. OSA-Express2 features are not supported on future servers. You should begin migrating from OSA-Express2 features (#3364, #3365, #3366) to OSA-Express3 1000BaseT and OSA-Express4S features.</p> 
							</li>  
							<li> 
								<strong>Dial-up modems.</strong>  
								<p>The z196 is the last high-end server, and the z114 is the last mid-range server, to support dial-up modems for use with the Remote Support Facility (RSF), and the External Time Source (ETS) option of Server Time Protocol (STP). These features are not supported on future servers. The currently available Network Time Protocol (NTP) server option for ETS, as well as Internet time services available using broadband connections, can be used to provide the same degree of accuracy as dial-up time services. You should begin migrating from dial-up modems to broadband for RSF connections.</p>

					<h5 id="wq851">Steps to take</h5>  
					<p>The following are general considerations related to I/O device support.</p>  
					<ul> 
						<li> 
							<em>Attaching devices through HCD.</em>  
							<p>You can define, or attach, new devices to your system through the interactive panels of the Hardware Configuration Definition (HCD) base element. HCD has dynamic I/O capabilities, changing hardware definitions without the need for an IPL or hard power-on reset.</p>  
							<p>Any time you make changes to your I/O configuration, you need to use HCD to modify your system's I/O definition file (IODF). You should also update the input/output configuration data set (IOCDS) when you run HCD to ensure that the configuration information is consistent across the software and microcode.</p> 
						</li>  
						<li> 
							<em>Operating modes.</em>  
							<p>Most devices attached to z/OS operate in full function mode, that is, all features on the device are compatible with, and usable on, the operating system. Some of these features include:</p>  
							<ul> 
								<li> 
									<p>For DASD devices: dynamic path reconnection, extended count-key-data operation, and caching and cache-related facilities</p> 
								</li>  
								<li> 
									<p>For tape devices: cartridge stack loading and data compaction</p> 
								</li> 
							</ul>  
							<p>Some devices also operate in compatibility mode, which allows you to simulate the function of another device or model. Compatibility mode causes the device to function like a different device of the same type, ignoring some or all of the additional features the device might have. This allows you to migrate between devices with minimal impact on programs that have device dependencies.</p> 
						</li>  
						<li> 
							<em>UCB virtual storage constraint relief.</em>  
							<p>Each device attached to the system has one or more UCBs associated with it. You have the option to define UCBs either above or below the 16 MB line by specifying the LOCANY parameter on the Hardware Configuration Definition (HCD) panel. The system programmer should review the contents of the link pack area (LPA) list to determine whether to remove or move libraries to gain virtual storage constraint relief.</p> 
						</li>  
						<li> 
							<em>Hardware maintenance.</em>  
							<p>Some devices require a specific level of hardware maintenance to operate properly on a z/OS system. DFSMS software support for new hardware devices might also require the installation of PTFs.</p> 
						</li> 
					</ul>  
					<h5 id="wq852">Reference information</h5>  
					<p>For more information, see the following references:</p>  
					<ul> 
						<li> 
							<p>For a summary of the most commonly-used I/O devices supported by z/OS that are also directly supported by DFSMS functions, see the topic about identifying I/O devices in 
								<cite>z/OS Planning for Installation</cite>. If you have a question about support for a device that is not listed, contact your IBM representative.

					<h5 id="wq865">Steps to take</h5>  
					<p>If you are migrating to a new CFCC level, do the following:</p>  
					<ol> 
						<li> 
							<p>Run the Coupling Facility Structure Sizer (CFSizer) tool. This tool sizes structures, taking into account the amount of space needed for the current CFCC levels. The tool sizes for the most currently available level; you might find that the results are oversized if you use an earlier CFCC level. You can find the tool at 
								<a href="http://www.ibm.com/systems/support/z/cfsizer/" target="_blank">Coupling Facility sizer (http://www.ibm.com/systems/support/z/cfsizer/)</a>.
							</p>  
							<p>Alternatively, you can run an as-is batch utility program called SIZER after you have brought a new CFLEVEL coupling facility into use in your configuration. SIZER examines your currently allocated coupling facility structures and recalculates the size that should be used for them with the new later-CFLEVEL coupling facility. The as-is SIZER utility is available as a zipped package that you can download from 
								<a href="http://www.ibm.com/systems/support/z/cfsizer/altsize.html">http://www.ibm.com/systems/support/z/cfsizer/altsize.html</a> .
							</p> 
						</li>  
						<li> 
							<p>Update the CFRM policy with the size modifications that are needed.</p> 
						</li>  
						<li> 
							<p>Activate the updated CFRM policy so that it becomes the active policy governing structure allocation in the sysplex.</p> 
						</li> 
					</ol>

						<p>As your applications grow in size and use greater amounts of storage, you should evaluate whether the DASD allocated for your stand-alone dump data continues to be adequate.</p>  
						<p>In z/OS V1R6, support was introduced for extended-format sequential data sets, a form of data set that is SMS-managed and can occupy more than 64 K tracks per volume. In z/OS V1R7, this support was supplemented with support for large format sequential data sets (DSNTYPE=LARGE), a form of data set that is essentially the same as conventional sequential data sets except that more than 64 K tracks may be spanned per volume. If your stand-alone dump data sets are spread over more volumes than you want, both types of support can help you gain better control over the number of volumes used for each stand-alone dump data set.</p>

						<h5 id="wq891">Steps to take</h5>  
						<p>Follow these steps:</p>  
						<ul> 
							<li> 
								<p>Use multivolume stand-alone dump data sets. Adjust the number of volumes and their separation to achieve tolerable stand-alone dump capture times.</p> 
							</li>  
							<li> 
								<p>Use extended-format sequential data sets or large format sequential data sets. Copy their contents to an extended-format, compressed, striped data set using the IPCS COPYDUMP subcommand before analysis. Use the same or a larger striping factor than you used for your stand-alone dump data sets. Dump data sets to which stand-alone dump can write may be neither compressed nor striped, but both attributes are advantageous for the target of the copy operation. Starting with z/OS V1R12, stand-alone dump data sets can be placed in track-managed space as well as cylinder-managed space on Extended Address Volumes (EAV).</p> 
							</li>  
							<li> 
								<p>Use a large CISIZE and striping for IPCS dump directories, and use blocking, striping, and compression for the stand-alone dump data set. Very large stand-alone dumps might require that you define your directory with the extended addressing attribute, allowing it to hold more than 4 GB.</p> Tip: Control interval sizes less than 24K have been shown to be more vulnerable to fragmentation when used as IPCS dump directories, and IPCS performance can be degraded when such fragmentation occurs. In this background, warning message BLS21110I will be issued and you might recreate the DDIR by using the CLIST BLSCDDIR. 
								<pre> 
<code>BLS21110I CISIZE(cisize) is less than 24K. It may degrade IPCS performance</code>

						<p>Check for JCL and programs that use the AMBLIST utility to write SYSPRINT output to a sequential data set, and ensure that block sizes are specified explicitly where appropriate. For example, suppose that a program that refers to the SYSPRINT data set expects a new SYSPRINT data set to have a block size of 121 ( BLKSIZE=121). If so, you must specify this value explicitly in the SYSPRINT DD statement when you run the AMBLIST utility. For any programs that open the SYSPRINT data set with the DCB parameters RECFM=FA or RECFM=FA,LRECL=121, remove the RECFM and LRECL parameter from the DCB macro. Or, change the record format value to FBA ( RECFM=FBA).</p>

						<p>IBM recommends that you use the highest format level LOGR couple data set (CDS) that can be used by the lowest system release level in your sysplex. This will allow for the latest system logger features to be available, given the sysplex configuration. Currently, the highest LOGR CDS format level is HBB7705 (introduced in z/OS V1R2).

						</table>  
						<h5 id="wq935">Steps to take</h5>  
						<p>Follow these steps:</p>  
						<ol> 
							<li> 
								<p>Determine your current LOGR couple data set level. Use the 
									<strong>D XCF,C,TYPE=LOGR</strong> command. If your LOGR couple data sets are at level HBB7705, you do not need to perform this migration action.
								</p> 
							</li>  
							<li> 
								<p>Use the IXCL1DSU (format couple data set utility) and include the ITEM NAME(SMDUPLEX) NUMBER(1) specification to obtain at least two LOGR CDSs at the HBB7705 format level, with:</p>  
								<ul> 
									<li> 
										<p>LOGR CDS 
											<em>primarydsname</em> on volume 
											<em>primaryvolume</em> 
										</p> 
									</li>  
									<li> 
										<p>LOGR CDS 
											<em>alternatedsname</em> on volume 
											<em>alternatevolume</em> 
										</p> 
									</li> 
								</ul> Note: SMDUPLEX item NUMBER(1) is the default value when you run the IXCL1DSU utility on z/OS V2R2.
							</li>  
							<li> 
								<p>After you create the HBB7705 format-level LOGR CDSs, you can dynamically bring them into your existing sysplex with these SETXCF commands:</p>  
								<ul> 
									<li> 
										<p>SETXCF COUPLE,TYPE=LOGR,ACOUPLE=( 
											<em>primarydsname</em>, 
											<em>primaryvolume</em>)
										</p> 
									</li>  
									<li> 
										<p>SETXCF COUPLE,TYPE=LOGR,PSWITCH</p> 
									</li>  
									<li> 
										<p>SETXCF COUPLE,TYPE=LOGR,ACOUPLE=( 
											<em>alternatedsname</em>, 
											<em>alternatevolume</em>)
										</p> 
									</li> 
								</ul> 
							</li>  
							<li> 
								<p>Remember to also specify, in your COUPLE xx member of SYS1.PARMLIB, these two LOGR CDSs as the primary and alternate for any future sysplex IPLs:</p>  
								<pre> 
<code>DATA TYPE(LOGR) PCOUPLE(
	<em>primarydsname</em>,
	<em>primaryvolume</em>) ACOUPLE(
	<em>alternatedsname</em>,
	<em>alternatevolume</em>)
</code>
								</pre> 
							</li> 
						</ol> Note: If you did not bring the newly formatted HBB7705 LOGR CDSs into the sysplex (with the SETXCF commands in the Step 3) prior to the first z/OS system that IPLs into the sysplex using the COUPLExx member identifying the newly formatted LOGR CDSs, then there will be no persistent logger data from before the IPL. Therefore, no log stream data exists when this first system IPLs.

					<title>Update a Capacity Provisioning Manager parameter to avoid a defined capacity WTOR</title>  
					<description><![CDATA[  
						<h5 id="wq955">Description</h5>  
						<p>In z/OS V2R2, the Provisioning Manager can detect when a manual change to defined capacity or group capacity would interfere significantly with Capacity Provisioning management. In such cases, the Provisioning Manager suspends its management of defined capacity or group capacity and issues one of the following write-to-operator-with-reply (WTOR) messages:</p>  
						<dl> 
							<dt>CPO4218I</dt>  
							<dd>New DC for 
								<em>systemName</em>/ 
								<em>sysplexName</em>. Previous base 
								<em>previousLimit</em> MSU. Enter 1 to set base to 
								<em>currentLimit</em> or 2 to set to 
								<em>newLimit</em> MSU
							</dd>  
							<dt>CPO4219I</dt>  
							<dd>New GC for 
								<em>groupName</em>/ 
								<em>CPCname</em>. Previous base 
								<em>previousLimit</em> MSU. Enter 1 to set base to 
								<em>currentLimit</em> or 2 to set to 
								<em>newLimit</em> MSU.
							</dd> 
						</dl>  
						<p>In response, the operator can choose to reinitialize the capacity management by setting the management base to the new capacity value and its managed capacity to 0, or continue the capacity management by adapting the management base to the manual change.</p>  
						<p>If you want the Provisioning Manager to continue managing the defined capacity or group capacity, regardless of manual changes, you can suppress the WTOR by setting the key 
							<strong>DefinedCapacity.BaseToleration</strong> to 100 in the Capacity Provisioning Manager parameter file.
						</p>  
						<p>In z/OS V2R2, the default value of this key is 15, meaning that while Capacity Provisioning is managing a defined capacity, any concurrent manual reduction in defined capacity by more than 15% causes the WTOR to be issued.</p>

					<title>Accommodate system symbol names that contain underscores</title>  
					<description><![CDATA[  
						<h5 id="wq1044">Description</h5>  
						<p>z/OS V2R2 enhances the use of system symbols in the following ways:</p>  
						<ul> 
							<li> 
								<p>Longer system symbol names (up to 16 characters) and longer symbol substitution values</p> 
							</li>  
							<li> 
								<p>Underscores (_) can be specified in any character position other than the first one.</p> 
							</li> 
						</ul>  
						<p>System symbols are typically used in started procedures and jobs, parmlib members, and other objects. Information about using system symbols is provided in 
							<cite>z/OS MVS Initialization and Tuning Reference</cite>.
						</p>  
						<p>For objects that undergo system symbol substitution, be aware that the use of underscores in symbol names can result in an incompatibility if a symbol reference is followed immediately by an underscore (that is, without a symbol-delimiting period). For example, in previous releases, specifying &amp;SYM_A in a file would match the symbol &amp;SYM and add "_A". In z/OS V2R2, this specification can match the symbol &amp;SYM or the symbol &amp;SYM_A. Here, a match is attempted first for &amp;SYM_A (with the underscore). If no match is found, an attempt is made to match &amp;SYM.</p> Note: As of z/OS z/OS 2.1, underscores can be specified in JES symbol names. Thus, this migration action does not apply to JES symbol names.

						<h5 id="wq1057">Steps to take</h5>  
						<p>In z/OS V2R2, IBM provides a REXX exec, ASASYMUN, to help you locate data that might encounter unexpected results if symbol names have underscores. You can run the exec on z/OS V2R2 and older systems.</p>  
						<p>ASASYMUN scans a PDS or PDSE for situations where a symbol name that contains an underscore might cause different results than expected. For example, it checks for a symbol (an ampersand followed by other characters) followed immediately by an underscore with no delimiting period. Change these lines to add a period before the underscore to delimit the symbol.</p>  
						<p>ASASYMUN is supplied by IBM in the SBLSCLI0 data set. To use ASASYMUN, you must invoke it from an ISPF environment.</p>  
						<p>Follow these steps:</p>  
						<ol> 
							<li> 
								<p>From the ISPF command line, run the exec as follows:</p>  
								<pre> 
<code>TSO EXEC
	<em>execdsn</em>(ASASYMUN) '
	<em>scandsn</em>'
</code>
								</pre>  
								<p>Where:</p>  
								<dl> 
									<dt> 
										<em>execdsn</em> 
									</dt>  
									<dd> 
										<p>is the cataloged data set containing the ASASYMUN exec. Use 'execdsn(ASASYMUN)' if the data set name is fully qualified. You can use alternative forms of execdsn(ASASYMUN) if the data set is in the SYSEXEC or SYSPROC concatenation of the user. For example, you might be able to specify just (ASASYMUN).</p> 
									</dd>  
									<dt> 
										<em>scandsn</em> 
									</dt>  
									<dd> 
										<p>is the PDS or PDSE you want to scan. Specify a data set contain statements subject to symbol substitution, like JCL or parmlib statements. If the data set name is fully qualified, double the quotations around the name in addition to the single quotation marks that surround the parameter. For example, specify '''fully.qual.dsn''' for a fully qualified data set.</p> 
									</dd> 
								</dl> 
							</li>  
							<li> 
								<p>For any references you find that were intended to be resolved by a symbol, add a period before the underscore to delimit the symbol. For example:</p>  
								<pre> 
<code>&amp;SYM._A</code>
								</pre> 
							</li>

					<title>Examine your IEFUSI exit routine for possible changes</title>  
					<description><![CDATA[  
						<h5 id="wq1089">Description</h5>  
						<p>z/OS V2R2 includes a number of functional enhancements to support improved region management, including:</p>  
						<dl> 
							<dt>REGIONX keyword</dt>  
							<dd> 
								<p>New JCL keyword for the JOB and EXEC statements. JCL programmers can use REGIONX to explicitly request precise below-the-line and above-the-line storage amounts.</p> 
							</dd>  
							<dt>SMFLIMxx parmlib member</dt>  
							<dd> 
								<p>New parmlib member. Your installation can use SMFLIMxx to set rules for the REGION and MEMLIMIT values in job steps, or cancel job steps that violate the rules.</p> 
							</dd> 
						</dl>  
						<p>These changes include new parameter input fields for the IEFUSI exit routine. If your installation uses an IEFUSI exit routine to control job region size, it is recommended that you examine the routine for possible changes that you might need to make.</p>  
						<p>Note the following changes in the exit input parameter list:</p>  
						<ul> 
							<li> 
								<p>If the REGIONX keyword is used, the "region requested" value in sub-word 2 (as pointed to by word 5) is updated to contain a value based on the two values that were supplied on the REGIONX keyword. This change allows an existing exit routine to continue to receive the total amount of storage that was requested by the job step. Specifically, the value now contains either of the following values:</p>  
								<ul> 
									<li> 
										<p>A value of 0 when the REGIONX second parameter is 0M, 0K, or 0G</p> 
									</li>  
									<li> 
										<p>The larger of the specified values when the REGIONX second parameter is not 0M, 0K, or 0G</p> 
									</li> 
								</ul>  
								<p>If the REGIONX keyword is not used, the IEFUSI input parameter list contains one "region requested" value in sub-word 2. This behavior is the same as in previous releases of z/OS.</p> 
							</li>  
							<li> 
								<p>For job steps that include the REGIONX keyword, sub-word 1, bit 3 (as pointed to by word 5), indicates that separate values are also available. Here, two more words are provided, sub-word 7 and 8 (as pointed to by word 5), which provide the below-the-line and above-the-line values on the REGIONX keyword.</p> 
							</li> 
						</ul>  
						<p>If the total size indicated in sub-word 2 is not specific enough for your purposes, you can have your exit routine can use the values in sub-word 7 and 8 to set the existing below- and above-the-line output fields in sub-words 2, 3, 4, and 5, as pointed to by word 5 of the input parameter list.</p>  
						<p>No additions or changes to the output parameter list are needed for REGIONX-related processing. The output parameter list allows for specifying separate above- and below-the-line values, as in previous releases of z/OS.</p>  
						<p>After the IEFUSI exit routine runs, the system checks the SMFLIMxx member for rules that might override region limits. This processing allows the existing IEFUSI exit to continue to set region and MEMLIMIT values for its various functions, including functions that are not supported by SMFLIMxx, such as setting limits on data space blocks. The SMFLIMxx member can be used to set values for new work or to override IEFUSI values for changes to existing work, thus reducing the need for more IEFUSI exit code changes.</p>  
						<p>In some cases, however, your installation might require that the IEFUSI exit routine make the final determination. If so, the exit routine can set a new flag (sub-word 1, bit 4, as pointed to by word 5) to bypass the SMFLIMxx rules. This bit essentially disables the SMFLIMxx processing for the current job step.</p> Note: A sample IEFUSI exit routine is provided in SYS1.SAMPLIB in member IEEUSI. For more information about changes that might be needed, see the commented sections in the sample IEFUSI exit routine.

						<p>Follow these steps:</p>  
						<ul> 
							<li> 
								<p>If your installation uses an IEFUSI exit routine, examine it to determine whether changes are required for the REGIONX keyword and SMFLIMxx member processing.</p>  
								<p>It is possible that no action is needed, if the decisions made by the exit routine are generic, such as setting the region above-the-line value 128 MB for all job steps. If the exit sets storage values using sub-word 2 (as pointed to by word 5) and a job uses REGIONX, the exit continues to set the desired value. Here, the REGIONX value is ignored and the IEFUSI selected storage value is used.</p>  
								<p>SMFLIMxx processing, if activated by specifying SMFLIM= as part of IPL parameters or through the SET SMFLIM= operator command, overrides the IEFUSI exit-returned values, if environmental conditions match the job step's current environment.</p> 
							</li>  
							<li> 
								<p>If you determine that your IEFUSI exit routine requires updating, you can modify your routine by using the new values in the input parameter list. For example, you can have your exit routine do the following:</p>  
								<ul> 
									<li> 
										<p>Use the new REGIONX values for below- and above-the-line storage for region size determinations. These values are provided in sub-word 7 and 8 (as pointed to by word 5), when sub-word 1, bit 3 is set to 1.</p>

									</li> 
								</ul>  
								<p>Or, you can remove all region and MEMLIMIT processing from your routine, and create SMFLIMxx statements to limit the REGION and MEMLIMIT values. Here, you might retain your routine to perform other types of processing, such as setting limits on data space blocks.</p>

					<title>Assess the use of the INCLUDE1MAFC keyword on the LFAREA parameter in IEASYSxx</title>  
					<description><![CDATA[  
						<h5 id="wq1104">Description</h5>  
						<p>Prior to z/OS V2R2, the default was for RSM not to include 1 M fixed frames in the available frame count (RCEAFC). APAR OA41968 added the INCLUDE1MAFC keyword on the LFAREA parameter in the IEASYSxx member of parmlib to cause RSM to include 1 M fixed frames in the available frame count. This results in the following system behavior:</p>  
						<ul> 
							<li> 
								<p>RSM performs less paging when there is an abundance of available 1 M fixed frames in the system.</p> 
							</li>  
							<li> 
								<p>RSM is more likely to break up 1 M fixed frames to satisfy 4 K page demand. Although RSM attempts to coalesce broken up 1 M fixed frames when there is fixed 1 M page demand, there is no guarantee that coalescing will be successful, especially if any of the 4 K frames making up the fixed 1 M page is fixed long term.</p> 
							</li> 
						</ul>  
						<p>Starting with z/OS V2R2, RSM includes 1 M fixed frames in the available frame count by default; you no longer need to specify INCLUDE1MAFC to do this. Furthermore, the syntax of the INCLUDE1MAFC keyword has been extended to include a YES or NO option. The former INCLUDE1MAFC keyword syntax is still valid and can now also be specified as INCLUDE1MAFC(YES).</p>  
						<p>IBM recommends that you accept the default (or specify INCLUDE1MAFC or INCLUDE1MAFC(YES)). However, if you have a need to retain the old default behavior (that is, to exclude 1 M fixed frames from the available frame count), you must specify INCLUDE1MAFC(NO).</p>

					<title>Plan for the use of freemained frames</title>  
					<description><![CDATA[  
						<h5 id="wq1118">Description</h5>  
						<p>To enhance system performance on the IBM z13, there might be cases where the system does not free the real frame that is backing a virtual page following a FREEMAIN, that is, when the page no longer contains any GETMAIN-assigned storage ranges. If so, the system will clear or "dirty" the frame to ensure that sensitive information is removed. Such a frame is referred to as a freemained frame. Freemained frames do not cause the count of frames owned by the address space (RAXFMCT) to be decremented (as they would have previously), nor do they cause the count of available frames within the system (RCEAFC) to be incremented (as they would have previously). Instead, the system uses a new counter, RAX_FREEMAINEDFRAMES, to keep track of the number of frames backing freemained pages in the address space with which the RAX is associated.</p>  
						<p>This feature is active by default on the IBM z13 and only applies to region private "low" storage (below 2GB), which is defined as subpools 0-127, 129-132, 240, 244, 250-252. Storage subpools define the characteristics of virtual storage below 2 GB and are discussed in detail in 
							<cite>z/OS MVS Diagnosis: Reference</cite>.
						</p>  
						<p>The SYSEVENT STGTEST API reports on the current usage of real storage, returning a three-word value:</p>  
						<dl> 
							<dt>Word 1</dt>  
							<dd> 
								<p>Use of this number affects system performance very little, if at all.</p> 
							</dd>  
							<dt>Word 2</dt>  
							<dd> 
								<p>Use of this number affects performance to some degree.</p> 
							</dd>  
							<dt>Word 3</dt>  
							<dd> 
								<p>Use of this number may substantially affect performance.</p> 
							</dd> 
						</dl>  
						<p>To maintain compatibility with prior releases, SYSEVENT STGTEST will include most of Rce_FreemainedFrames in word 1 and all of it in words 2 and 3 for z/OS V2R1 (HBB7790) and z/OS V1R13 (JBB778H). For z/OS V2R2 (HBB77A0), SYSEVENT STGTEST is changed to exclude Rce_FreemainedFrames from word 1.</p>  
						<p>Programs that reference or issue TPROT instructions against region private storage that is not GETMAIN assigned might not experience an 0C4 system abend nor get a non-zero condition code where they previously would have. This applies to the subpools listed earlier.</p>  
						<p>The following new parameters in the DIAGxx member of parmlib allow you to disable this feature, if necessary:</p>  
						<dl> 
							<dt>FREEMAINEDFRAMES(NO)</dt>  
							<dd> 
								<p>Disables the freemained frames feature on a system-wide basis.</p> 
							</dd>  
							<dt>FREEMAINEDFRAMES(YES) [EXCLUDEJOBLIST( 
								<em>job1</em>[, 
								<em>job2</em>,...])]
							</dt>  
							<dd> 
								<p>Enables the freemained frames feature, except for the specified jobs. Up to eight job names may be specified. The job names may include the * and ? wildcard characters, where the * character is allowed in any position.</p>  
								<p>Reissuing the SET DIAG command with different EXCLUDEJOBLIST values will 
									<em>not</em> increase the total number of excluded jobs; the last EXCLUDEJOBLIST specification overrides any previous specifications.
								</p>  
								<p>Disabling this feature for selected jobs will cause performance degradation for the entire system, not just for the specified jobs.</p> 
							</dd> 
						</dl>  
						<p>You can use the DISPLAY DIAG command to verify that the system is using the requested FREEMAINEDFRAMES statement.</p> Note: The DISPLAY DIAG command does not report the default value. The FREEMAINEDFRAMES statement only appears in the IGV007I message when it has been specified in the DIAGxx member. Therefore, you can use the DISPLAY DIAG command to verify that the system is using the specified FREEMAINEDFRAMES statement.

								<p>Verify that the value of RceOA46291Applied is B'1' before using any other new fields in the RCE or RAX data areas, as the new fields are not guaranteed to be initialized otherwise.</p> 
							</li>  
							<li> 
								<p>Programs that reference RAXFMCT can subtract Rax_FreemainedFrames to determine how much real storage the address space is currently using.</p> 
							</li>  
							<li> 
								<p>Programs that reference RCEAFC can add RCE_FreemainedFrames to determine how much storage is not currently in use. If an application is referencing RCEAFC to determine how much storage is available to be used by the application, a better solution is to use SYSEVENT STGTEST.</p> 
							</li>  
							<li> 
								<p>If an application needs to determine whether a virtual address range is GETMAIN assigned, it should use the VSMLOC or VSMLIST services, instead of using the LRAG or TPROT assembly language instructions. These services are documented in 
									<cite>z/OS MVS Programming: Authorized Assembler Services Reference SET-WTO</cite> and can be invoked regardless of whether the caller is running in a cross-memory environment (although they would only be applicable to the primary address space).
								</p>  
								<p>The IARQDUMP callable service can be used to determine whether there is some virtual storage backing a given page and is documented in 
									<cite>z/OS MVS Programming: Authorized Assembler Services Guide</cite>.
								</p>  
								<p>If neither of these approaches are feasible, perhaps due to concerns about performance, the following new callable services provide the same results as the TPROT instruction while also taking freemained frames into account:</p>  
								<ul> 
									<li> 
										<p>IARBRVER takes in general purpose register (GPR) 1 the virtual address of the page and returns one of the following codes in GPR 15:</p>  
										<dl> 
											<dt>Code</dt>  
											<dd> 
												<p>Meaning</p> 
											</dd>  
											<dt>0</dt>  
											<dd>

											<dd> 
												<p>Caller has Read-only access (no write access) to the data.</p> 
											</dd>  
											<dt>2</dt>  
											<dd> 
												<p>Caller has neither read nor write access to the data.</p> 
											</dd>  
											<dt>3</dt>  
											<dd> 
												<p>The page either cannot be translated or is backed by a freemained frame.</p> 
											</dd> 
										</dl> 
									</li>  
									<li> 
										<p>IARBRVEA is similar to IARBRVER except that it is invoked in AR mode and access register (AR) 1 contains the ALET associated with the virtual address to be tested. This entry should be used when the page to be tested does not reside in the primary address space.</p> 
									</li>

					<description><![CDATA[  
						<h5 id="wq1136">Description</h5>  
						<p>In z/OS V2R2, the Cross System Extended Services (XES) buffers for component tracing are moved from a common area data space (CADS) to a 4 GB memory object in 64-bit common high virtual (HVCOMMON) storage. During system initialization, XES obtains a 4 GB memory object and manages the virtual storage for global and connection CTRACE buffers. This change allows the GLOBAL trace buffer to be increased from 16 MB to 32 MB (fixed), which reduces the possibility of buffer wrapping. It also increases the available address range for connector trace buffers, which decreases the possibility of a connector running without component tracing.</p>  
						<p>In previous releases, the XES CTRACE buffers resided in a CADS object named IXLCTCAD, which limited the buffers to a 2 GB range of addresses. In z/OS V2R2, XES no longer creates the IXLCTCAD object.</p> Notes: 
						<ol> 
							<li> 
								<p>The 4 GB memory object is a fixed size area that is obtained by XES; the size cannot be modified.</p>

								<p>Ensure that enough 64-bit common storage (HVCOMMON) storage is allocated by the system, so that the additional 4 GB request by XES does not cause shortages for other components and elements. The amount of 64-bit common storage is controlled by the HVCOMMON parameter in the IEASYSxx parmlib member. Review the value that is specified on the HVCOMMON parameter to determine whether it must be increased. You can use the MVS operator command 
									<strong>D VIRTSTOR,HVCOMMON</strong> to display information about the current use of the HVCOMMON storage on your system.

					<title>MVS SLIP command change for MODE=HOME</title>  
					<description><![CDATA[  
						<h5 id="wq1152">Description</h5>  
						<p>When a 
							<strong>SLIP</strong> command is issued for a PER trap with 
							<strong>MODE=HOME</strong> specified, but without 
							<strong>JOBNAME</strong> and 
							<strong>ASID</strong> specified, the system issues message IEE088D to prompt the operator for a reply (continue or cancel).
						</p>  
						<p>The 
							<strong>JOBNAME</strong>, 
							<strong>ASID</strong>, and 
							<strong>MODE</strong> parameters for a 
							<strong>SLIP</strong> command work together to control the cross memory environment for a PER interrupt. Specifying 
							<strong>MODE=HOME</strong> indicates that the SLIP trap matches only when the command is running in the home address space. When 
							<strong>MODE=HOME</strong> is specified, more processing is used to monitor for the correct environment. When 
							<strong>MODE=HOME</strong> is specified with the 
							<strong>JOBNAME</strong> or 
							<strong>ASID</strong> parameter, this monitoring is limited to the specified address spaces.
						</p>  
						<p>However, if 
							<strong>MODE=HOME</strong> is specified without 
							<strong>JOBNAME</strong> and 
							<strong>ASID</strong>, the monitoring occurs for every address space on the system, which can impact performance significantly. As a warning, the system issues message IEE088D with either of the following text strings:
						</p>  
						<pre> 
<code>IEE088D SLIP COMMAND SPECIFIES MODE=HOME WITHOUT JOBNAME AND ASID. SPECIFY 'OK' OR 'CANCEL' IEE088D SLIP ID=xxxx SPECIFIES MODE=HOME WITHOUT JOBNAME AND ASID. SPECIFY 'OK' OR 'CANCEL'</code>
						</pre> Note: When this capability was introduced in z/OS V2R1 with APAR OA45297 and even after APAR OA45912, you enabled it by specifying the option TRAPS NAME(IeaSlipConfirm) in the DIAGxx parmlib member. However, in z/OS V2R2, this capability is enabled automatically; you no longer need to specify it explicitly. If you do so in z/OS V2R2, the explicit specification is ignored without an error.

						</p>  
						<p>Follow these steps:</p>

							<li> 
								<p>If a

									<strong>OK</strong> parameter to avoid message IEE088D.
								</p> 
							</li>  
							<li> 
								<p>If you already include the 
									<strong>OK</strong> parameter on the

								</pre>  
								<p>For example, if you have a SLIP trap that is defined as follows, verify that

						<p>Before you begin, ensure that the PFA user has READ access to the /etc/PFA/ini file. Also, the operator must have proper authority to read or update the files, as needed.</p>  
						<p>When PFA is started, PFA attempts to use the values in the /etc/PFA/ini file.</p>  
						<p>Follow these steps:</p>  
						<ol> 
							<li> 
								<p>If the /etc/PFA/ini file already exists, PFA uses the existing 
									<strong>JAVAPATH</strong>, 
									<strong>PATH</strong>, and 
									<strong>LIBPATH</strong> that are in the file. Update the values as necessary.
								</p> 
							</li>  
							<li> 
								<p>If the /etc/PFA/ini file file does not exist, PFA attempts to create the /etc/PFA/ini file file from an existing check, or it uses the values defined in the /usr/lpp/bcp/samples/PFA/ini file. To ensure that the 
									<strong>JAVAPATH</strong>, 
									<strong>PATH</strong>, and 
									<strong>LIBPATH</strong> values are correct for your installation before PFA starts, copy /usr/lpp/bcp/samples/PFA/ini into /etc/PFA/ini and update the values as necessary.
								</p> 
							</li> 
						</ol>  
						<p>For example, check the values for the 
							<strong>JAVAPATH</strong>, 
							<strong>PATH</strong>, and 
							<strong>LIBPATH</strong> to be certain they are at the correct level for PFA. In z/OS V2R2, PFA uses a minimum level of Java 7.1 (31-bit) as in the following examples for the

						<h5 id="wq1241">Description</h5>  
						<p>As of z/OS V2R2, the minimum authorization requirements for callers of the Workload Management service, IWM4HLTH (setting the server health indicator), are changed. Problem state with any PSW key is sufficient only for setting the health indicator for the home address space of the calling application.</p>  
						<p>To set the health indicator for another address space, the caller must have at least one of the following authorizations:</p>  
						<ul> 
							<li> 
								<p>Supervisor state</p> 
							</li>  
							<li> 
								<p>Program key mask (PKM) with at least one of the keys 0 - 7</p> 
							</li>  
							<li> 
								<p>UPDATE authority to the resource IWM.SERVER.HEALTH in the FACILITY class.</p> 
							</li> 
						</ul>  
						<p>Also, callers of the IWM4HLTH service are recommended to avoid setting the health value to less than 100 for any purposes other than for server health. In z/OS V2R2, a server health value of less than 100 can result in false positives, as follows:</p>  
						<ul> 
							<li> 
								<p>Runtime Diagnostics creates a diagnostic event for each address space with a server health value less than 100, regardless of the reason. Events that are created for reasons other than server health might be considered as false events by the user of Runtime Diagnostics.</p> 
							</li>  
							<li> 
								<p>Predictive Failure Analysis (PFA) issues exceptions for Runtime Diagnostics events that are received for server health values less than 100. PFA exceptions that are issued for these events might be considered as false positive exceptions by the user of PFA.</p>

						<p>The z/OS V2R2 coupling facility (CF) gain ownership processing enhancements introduce a new COUPLExx parmlib member keyword: CFRMTAKEOVERCF. Specifying CFRMTAKEOVERCF(NO) enables CF gain ownership processing enhancements that might prevent a sysplex outage by avoiding operator errors. CFRMTAKEOVERCF(NO) is also the default for z/OS V2R2. CFRMTAKEOVERCF(PROMPT) can be specified to get a z/OS V2R2 system to prompt the operator as it did in prior releases of z/OS.</p>  
						<p>When the CFRMOWNEDCFPROMPT(YES) is specified by the COUPLExx parmlib member of a down-level system (prior to z/OS V2R2), the z/OS V2R2 default of CFRMTAKEOVERCF(NO) is not compatible with the configuration.</p>  
						<p>When CFRMOWNEDCFPROMPT(YES) is used by a down-level system, that system will clear the CF authorities saved in the CFRM CDS during CFRM and sysplex initialization (that is, a sysplex-wide IPL). When that occurs, an up-level system (z/OS V2R2) will reject use of any CF that has a non-zero authority. However, CFRMTAKEOVERCF(NO) is not intended to reject the use of the CF when the old CF authority in the CFRM CDS matches the CF authority in the CF. If a down-level system is no longer in the sysplex, no system will perform the desired prompting.</p>  
						<p>When the CFRMOWNEDFPROMPT(NO) is specified (or defaulted) by the COUPLExx parmlib member of a down-level system, the z/OS V2R2 default of CFRMTAKEOVERCF(NO) is compatible with the configuration.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[  
						<h5 id="wq1311">Description</h5>  
						<p>Before APAR OA47439, large memory objects were included in stand-alone dumps, which contributed to longer stand-alone dump times. With the PTF for APAR OA47439 applied, this default behavior is changed to improve stand-alone dump processing time.</p>  
						<p>As part of this support, a new keyword, SADMP= 
							<em>DEFAULT</em>  
							<em>YES</em>  
							<em>NO</em> , is added to the IARV64 macro. This keyword is used to specify whether a memory object is to be included in a stand-alone dump by default.
						</p>  
						<p>The SADMP keyword is added to the IARV64 macro for the following options:</p>  
						<ul> 
							<li> 
								<p>IARV64 REQUEST=GETSTOR</p> 
							</li>  
							<li> 
								<p>IARV64 REQUEST=GETCOMMON</p> 
							</li>  
							<li> 
								<p>IARV64 REQUEST=GETSHARED</p> 
							</li> 
						</ul>  
						<p>SADMP=NO is the default when PAGEFRAMESIZE=2G is specified on the IARV64 REQUEST=GETSTOR macro invocation. Previously, the default behavior was equivalent to specifying SADMP=YES. The new default behavior can help to reduce stand-alone dump capture times by avoiding the inclusion of large memory objects and their associated real storage in the dump. To have this type of memory object included in a stand-alone dump, you must allow it explicitly by specifying SADMP=YES.</p>

							<p>z/OS V2R2 is the last release in which the Simple Mail Transport Protocol Network Job Entry (SMTPD NJE) Mail Gateway and Sendmail mail transports are planned to be supported. If you use the SMTPD NJE Gateway to send mail, IBM recommends that you use the CSSMTP SMTP NJE Mail Gateway instead. CSSMTP provides functional and performance improvements, and is designed so that application programming changes are not required.</p>  
							<p>No replacement functions are planned for the SMTPD or Sendmail listener support; these functions allow for receiving mail for delivery to local TSO/E or z/OS UNIX System Services user mailboxes, or for forwarding mail to other destinations.</p>

						<p>If your policy is not generated by IBM Configuration Assistant for z/OS Communications Server, search your IPSec policy files for any KeyExchangeOffer statements that do not specify a DHGroup parameter. If you find such a KeyExchangeOffer statement, your policy is effected. If you require the DHGroup value to continue to use the previous default of Group1, update your policy to explicitly set the DHGroup parameter to Group1. If you want to use the new default, you need to coordinate with the owners of each remote IKE peer that is associated with the z/OS policy changes to ensure that the remote peer's policy is compatible with the z/OS changes. If the z/OS policy changes so that it is incompatible with the remote peer's policy, the IKE daemons will no longer be able to successfully negotiate IPSec tunnels.</p> Note: Diffie-Hellman group 1 is considered a weak algorithm and is not recommended.

						<instructions>This portion of the Workflow will guide you to submit a job to run an IBM Health Check for z/OS associated with this migration action, 
							<strong>ZOSMIGV2R2_NEXT_CS_LEGACYDEVICE</strong>. 
							<p>This check will be activated if it is not already active. If the check is activated, it will be deactivated at the end of the job, so that it remains in the same state as it was found.</p>  
							<p>If the health check runs with no exception, this step will be marked "Complete" indicating that this migration action requires no more activity.</p>  
							<p>If the health check finds an exception, this step will be marked as "Failed". This tells you that further investigation (and possibly more work) is necessary to complete this migration action. If the step is marked "Failed", you should review the health check output (via any method you use to view health check output, such as SDSF) and correct any situation that you find appropriate. You can then re-run this Workflow step to submit the health check job again, until the health check no longer receives an exception and the step is marked "Complete". This check will only run on z/OS V2.1 and higher, with TCP/IP APAR PI49962 and SNA APAR OA49071 applied.</p>

						<p>In z/OS V2R1 Communications Server, VTAM provided physical function services for IBM 10GbE RoCE Express features used for Shared Memory Communications via Remote Direct Memory Access (SMC-R) processing.

						<p>Before starting your TCP/IP stacks that activate 10GbE RoCE Express features, perform the following steps:</p>  
						<ol> 
							<li> 
								<p>Use the hardware configuration definition (HCD) to define a unique FID value for each TCP/IP stack that will be activating the 10GbE RoCE Express feature. You must also assign a virtual function number (VFN) for each potential user of the 10GbE RoCE Express feature.</p> 
							</li>  
							<li> 
								<p>Modify the GLOBALCONFIG SMCR statement in the TCP/IP profile to specify the PFID values that are assigned for this stack. Update the GLOBALCONFIG statements for all TCP/IP stacks that activate a given 10GbE RoCE Express before starting any of the TCP/IP stacks. The PFID values should correspond to the FID values you defined in the HCD.</p>

						<p>Review each of the Communications Server components that follow to determine whether you are affected. Make changes as directed. For applications that are protected by AT-TLS and that require SSLV3, evaluate their usage and change them to use TLS protocols, if possible. TLS addresses many security deficiencies that exist in the prior SSLv2 and SSLv3 protocols. For applications that must continue to use SSLv3, you can explicitly enable this protocol, as described in the sections that follow.</p>  
						<dl> 
							<dt>AT-TLS</dt>  
							<dd> 
								<p>AT-TLS is modified to disable SSLv3 by default. Any applications that are protected by AT-TLS default to SSLv3 Off.</p>  
								<p>If SSLv3 is explicitly enabled in your policy, no action is required. However, it is recommended that you evaluate whether applications can be updated to use a more secure protocol version, such as TLSv1, TLSv1.1, or TLSv1.2.</p>  
								<p>Applications that require SSLv3, and for which this protocol is not explicitly enabled in the policy, rely on AT-TLS defaults. For these applications, you can enable SSLv3 at the environment or connection level by specifying the parameter SSLv3 on the relevant TTLSEnvironmentAdvancedParms or TTLSConnectionAdvancedParms policy statement with a value of ON. For Configuration Assistant users, you can enable SSLv3 in the 
									<strong>name</strong> tab of the Modify Security Level dialog under the AT-TLS perspective.
								</p> 
							</dd>  
							<dt>FTP client and server</dt>

						<h5 id="wq1547">Description</h5>  
						<p>In z/OS V2R2, enhancements were made to the Communications Server outbound serialization function, which is controlled by the QUEUEDRTT parameter on the TCPCONFIG profile statement. The default value for this parameter is changed. Previously, the default setting for QUEUEDRTT was 20, meaning that only TCP/IP connections with a round-trip time (RTT) value of 20 milliseconds or more are eligible to use outbound serialization. In z/OS V2R2, the default value for QUEUEDRTT is changed to 0, meaning that all TCP/IP connections are eligible to use outbound serialization.</p>

					<title>IP Services: Check code that automates on IKE daemon syslogd messages</title>  
					<description><![CDATA[  
						<h5 id="wq1574">Description</h5>  
						<p>Scalability enhancements in z/OS V2R2 Communications Server introduce a new internal thread pool to the Internet Key Exchange (IKE) daemon. As part of this change, all of the IKED messages that are written through syslogd will contain the thread identifier in the syslogd header, which precedes the message identifier. In addition, messages from different IKED threads might be interleaved. These changes might affect the automation code that parses these IKED messages:</p>  
						<ul> 
							<li> 
								<p>If the automation code parses individual IKED messages in syslogd destinations based on any sort of position-based logic (for example, counting blanks delimiters, relying on a specific column), you need to update to account for the new thread id field.</p> 
							</li>  
							<li> 
								<p>If the automation code parses individual IKED messages based on message content (for example, searching the string for specific message identifiers), no change is needed.</p> 
							</li>  
							<li> 
								<p>If the automation code depends on the order of the IKED messages, you might need to update to take the thread id field into account so that the code ignores messages from other threads that are interleaved with the messages of interest.</p> 
							</li> 
						</ul>  
						<p>IKED messages are those in the ranges EZD0902I - EZD1160I, EZD1751I - EZD1800I, and EZD1901I - EZD1925I as well as EZD2017I, EZD2019I, EZD2025I and EZD2027I.</p>  
						<p>The following example shows a small excerpt of messages from z/OS V2R1 and the equivalent messages from z/OS V2R2 with the imbedded thread identifiers:</p>

						<title>ICSF: Detect any coprocessor that will not become active when HCR77A1 or later is started</title>  
						<description><![CDATA[  
							<h5 id="wq1617">Description</h5>  
							<p>For ICSF FMIDS HCR7780, HCR7790, and HCR77A0, the activation procedure was designed to maximize the number of active coprocessors by selecting the set of master keys that are available on the majority of coprocessors. A DES master key is no longer required in order for a coprocessor to become active. Instead, any one of four master keys - the DES master key, the AES master key, the RSA master key (which in earlier releases was called the asymmetric master key), or the ECC master key - is enough for a coprocessor to become active. However, because the goal is to select the combination of master keys that will maximize the number of active coprocessors, if a certain master key is not set on all the same coprocessors, that master key support will not be available.</p>  
							<p>Starting with FMID HCR77A1, the activation procedure now uses the master key verification patterns (MKVP) in the header record of the CKDS and PKDS to determine which coprocessors become active. If the MKVP of a master key is in the CKDS or PKDS, that master key must be loaded and the verification pattern of the current master key register must match the MKVP in the CKDS or PKDS. If all of the MKVPs in the CKDS and PKDS match the current master key registers, the coprocessor will become active. Otherwise, the status is master keys incorrect. This applies to all master keys that the coprocessor supports. When there is a MKVP in the CKDS or PKDS and the coprocessor does not support that master key, it is ignored. When a MKVP is not in the CKDS or PKDS, the master key is ignored.</p>  
							<p>If there are no MKVPs in the CKDS and PKDS, the coprocessor will be active. If the CKDS is initialized without any MKVPs, the CKDS cannot be used on a system that has cryptographic features installed.</p>

						<title>ICSF: Detect TKDS objects that are too large for the new record format in HCR77A1</title>  
						<description><![CDATA[  
							<h5 id="wq1631">Description</h5>  
							<p>In ICSF FMID HCR77A1, ICSF is introducing a common key data set record format for CCA key tokens and PKCS #11 tokens and objects. This new record format adds new fields for key utilization and metadata. Because of the size of the new fields, some existing PKCS #11 objects in the TKDS might cause ICSF to fail. If you do not have a Token Data Set (TKDS) with PKDS #11 objects in it, there is no need to run this check.</p>  
							<p>The problem exists for TKDS object records with large objects. The User data field in the existing record will cause the TKDS not be to loaded if the object size is greater that 32,520 bytes. The TKDSREC_LEN field in the record has the size of the object. If the User data field is not empty and the size of the object is greater than 32,520 bytes, the TKDS cannot be loaded.</p>  
							<p>Note that ICSF does not provide any interface to modify the User data field in the TKDS object record. A field can be created using IDCAMS. Check the contents of the User data field and determine if the information in the field is valuable. If you want to preserve the data, consider how the information can be stored other than in the object record. The field can only be modified by editing the record. For information about the TKDS object record, see 
								<cite>z/OS Cryptographic Services ICSF System Programmer's Guide</cite>. The IBM Health Checker migration check, ICSFMIG77A1_TKDS_OBJECT detects any TKDS object that is too large to allow the TKDS is read into storage during ICSF initialization starting with ICSF FMID HCR77A1. This migration check is available for HCR7770, HR7780, HCR7790, and HCR77A0 through APAR OA42011

						<instructions>This portion of the Workflow will guide you to submit a job to run an IBM Health Check for z/OS associated with this migration action, 
							<strong>IBMICSF,ICSFMIG77A1_TKDS_OBJECT</strong>. 
							<p>This check will be activated if it is not already active. If the check is activated, it will be deactivated at the end of the job, so that it remains in the same state as it was found.</p>  
							<p>If the health check runs with no exception, this step will be marked "Complete" indicating that this migration action requires no more activity.</p>  
							<p>If the health check finds an exception, this step will be marked as "Failed". This tells you that further investigation (and possibly more work) is necessary to complete this migration action. If the step is marked "Failed", you should review the health check output (via any method you use to view health check output, such as SDSF) and correct any situation that you find appropriate. You can then re-run this Workflow step to submit the health check job again, until the health check no longer receives an exception and the step is marked "Complete".</p>  
							<p>This health check is only applicable for ICSF FMIDs prior to HCR77A1. z/OS V2.1 has ICSF level HCR77A0 in the base. If you have the ICSF Web deliverable for FMID HCR77A1 installed on your z/OS V2.1 system, then this health check is expected to not be found and this migration action can be skipped.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[  
						<h5 id="wq1646">Description</h5>  
						<p>Due to service introduced by APAR OA43937, new Hash Method Rule keywords for the ICSF One-Way Hash Generate (CSNBOWH or CSNBOWH1 and CSNEOWH or CSNEOWH1) and PKCS11 One-Way Hash Services (CSFPOWH and CSFPOWH6) will support generation of legacy hash values for verification of archived hash values generated from pre-OA43937 releases of HCR7770 and higher.</p> Note: This correction of hashing function does not apply to the case where the sum of the length of hashed text over a series of chained calls exceeds 256 megabytes (or 512, as described further in this topic), but no single invocation supplies an input 
						<em>text_length</em> that exceeds 256 (or 512) megabytes. Correct hashes are created when no single invocation of the callable services exceeds the described limit prior to (and after) application of the PTFs for OA43937. 
						<p>Applications that wish to verify archived hash values created by pre-OA43937 HCR7770 and higher releases of ICSF callable services One-Way Hash Generate and PKCS11 One-Way Hash may need to invoke these callable services with new rule array keywords that support the creation of legacy hash values. The hash generated using the new rule array keywords must be used to verify the archived hash values.</p>  
						<p>The ICSF Callable Services One-Way Hash Generate and PKCS11 One-Way Hash, sign, or verify have corrected the way they create hash values when the length of the text on a single invocation of one of these services supplies an input 
							<em>text_length</em> that equals or exceeds 256 megabytes (512 megabytes on z990/z890 or later hardware on HCR7770). The hashing services are corrected with the application of the PTFs for OA43937.

						<h5 id="wq1696">Description</h5>  
						<p>Starting in z/OS V2R2, z/OS System SSL has changed its default protocol support. When a System SSL application calls the 
							<strong>gsk_environment_open()</strong> routine to establish a secure environment, SSL V2 and SSL V3 will now be disabled by default. TLS V1.0 will continue to be enabled by default. For applications that must continue to use these protocols, the protocol must be explicitly enabled.
						</p>  
						<p>If SSL V2, SSL V3, or both are the only supported protocols in the application, the following are example SSL errors that may occur when the SSL V2 or SSL V3 protocols are disabled:</p>  
						<ul> 
							<li> 
								<p>Return code 402: No SSL cipher specifications.</p> 
							</li>  
							<li> 
								<p>Return code 412: SSL protocol or certificate type is not supported.</p> 
							</li>  
							<li> 
								<p>Return code 429: SSL V2 header is not valid.</p> 
							</li> 
						</ul>  
						<p>For applications that use the SSL V2 or SSL V3 protocol, evaluate the application's usage and change the application to use the TLS protocols if possible. TLS has addressed many security deficiencies in the prior SSL V2 and SSL V3 protocols.</p>

						<p>If your installation utilizes System SSL applications for secure SSL/TLS connections, examine those applications to determine if they require either the SSL V2 or SSL V3 protocols to be enabled.</p>  
						<p>z/OS System SSL provides two methods for controlling the SSL/TLS protocols supported when negotiating a secure connection:</p>  
						<ul> 
							<li> 
								<p>The first method is the Application Programming Interface (API) 
									<strong>gsk_attribute_set_enum()</strong> routine. This routine allows the enablement of the SSL/TLS protocols at either the SSL/TLS environment or connection level. To enable the usage of SSL V2, enumeration parameter GSK_PROTOCOL_SSLV2 must be set to GSK_PROTOCOL_SSLV2_ON. To enable the usage of SSL V3, enumeration parameter GSK_PROTOCOL_SSLV3 must be set to GSK_PROTOCOL_SSLV3_ON.
								</p> 
							</li>  
							<li> 
								<p>The second method uses environment variables GSK_PROTOCOL_SSLV3 and GSK_PROTOCOL_SSLV2. To enable the usage of SSL V2, environment variable GSK_PROTOCOL_SSLV2 must be set to ON, 1, or ENABLED. To enable the usage of SSL V3, environment variable GSK_PROTOCOL_SSLV3 must be set to ON, 1, or ENABLED. Note that an environment variable setting is overridden if the application calls the gsk_attribute_set_enum() routine to set the GSK_PROTOCOL_SSLV2 and GSK_PROTOCOL_SSLV3 values.</p> 
							</li> 
						</ul>  
						<p>If the protocols are required, consult each application configuration documentation to determine the appropriate enablement capability.</p>

						<p>If your System SSL written application needs to support one or more of the removed ciphers, z/OS System SSL provides two methods to override the default SSL/TLS ciphers enabled when negotiating a secure connection using the SSL/TLS routines. Your application will need to utilize one of the following methods:</p>  
						<dl> 
							<dt>Method 1</dt>  
							<dd> 
								<p>Use the 
									<strong>gsk_attribute_set_buffer()</strong> or 
									<strong>gsk_secure_soc_init()</strong> routine:
								</p>  
								<dl> 
									<dt>gsk_attribute_set_buffer()</dt>  
									<dd> 
										<p>The 
											<strong>gsk_attribute_set_buffer()</strong> routine supports the specification of SSL V2 and SSL V3/TLS ciphers in preference order through the GSK_V2_CIPHER_SPECS, GSK_V3_CIPHER_SPECS, and GSK_V3_CIPHER_SPECS_EXPANDED attributes. Each attribute buffer consists of a single character string consisting of the cipher values enabled to be used for the secure connection.
										</p>  
										<p>To re-enable one or more of the SSL V2 ciphers, specify the GSK_V2_CIPHER_SPECS attribute along with the complete list of ciphers to be available during the negotiation of the secure connection. For example, if you want to restore the V2 default cipher list, you need to set the buffer value to "713642" when the System SSL Security Level 3 FMID (JCPT421) is installed. Otherwise, set the buffer to "642". Setting the value to "713642" when the System SSL Security Level 3 FMID (JCPT421) is not installed results in ciphers "713" being ignored.</p>  
										<p>To re-enable one or more of the SSL V3 ciphers, specify GSK_V3_CIPHER_SPECS if 2-character cipher specifications is enabled (this is the default), or GSK_V3_CIPHER_SPECS_EXPANDED if 4-character cipher specifications is enabled along with the complete list of ciphers to be available during the negotiation of the secure connection. For example, if you want to restore the SSL V3 2-character default cipher list, set the buffer value to "050435363738392F303132330A1613100D0915120F0C0306020100" when the System SSL Security Level 3 FMID (JCPT421) is installed. Otherwise, set the buffer to "0915120F0C0306020100". Setting the value to "050435363738392F303132330A1613100D0915120F0C0306020100" when the System SSL Security Level 3 FMID (JCPT421) is not installed results in ciphers "050435363738392F303132330A1613100D" being ignored. When using the 4-character cipher values, the buffer value is "0005000400350036003700380039002F0030003100320033000A0016001 30010000D000900150012000F000C00030006000200010000" when the System SSL Security Level 3 FMID (JCPT421) is installed. Otherwise, set the buffer to "000900150012000F000C00030006000200010000". Setting the value to "0005000400350036003700380039002F0030003100320033000A0016001 30010000D000900150012000F000C00030006000200010000" when the System SSL Security Level 3 FMID (JCPT421) is not installed results in ciphers "0005000400350036003700380039002F0030003100320033000A0016001 30010000D" being ignored.</p> 
									</dd>  
									<dt>gsk_secure_soc_init()</dt>  
									<dd> 
										<p>The 
											<strong>gsk_secure_soc_init()</strong> routine (deprecated API) supports the specification of SSL V2 and SSL V3/TLS ciphers through the 
											<em>cipher_specs</em> and 
											<em>v3cipher_specs</em> fields in the 
											<em>gsk_soc_init_data</em> structure.
										</p>  
										<p>To re-enable one or more of the SSL V2 ciphers, specify the complete list of ciphers to be available during the negotiation of the secure connection in the 
											<em>cipher_specs</em> field. For example, if you want to restore the SSL V2 default cipher list, set the buffer value to "713642" when the System SSL Security Level 3 FMID (JCPT421) is installed. Otherwise, set the buffer to "642". Setting the value to "713642" when the System SSL Security Level 3 FMID (JCPT421) is not installed results in ciphers "713" being ignored.
										</p>  
										<p>To re-enable one or more of the SSL V3/TLS ciphers, specify the complete list of ciphers to be available during the negotiation of the secure connection in the 
											<em>v3cipher_specs</em> field. For example, if you want to restore the SSL V3 2-character default cipher list, set the buffer value to "050435363738392F303132330A1613100D0915120F0C0306020100" when the System SSL Security Level 3 FMID (JCPT421) is installed.

A default CTICSF00 PARMLIB member is installed in SYS1.PARMLIB. The CTICSF00 PARMLIB member provides default component trace values for ICSF. By default, ICSF CTRACE support will trace with the KdsIO, CardIO, and SysCall filters using a 2M buffer.

						<p>You can code the new CTRACE option within a BEGIN(HCR77A1) END option pair in a options data set shared between multiple releases of ICSF.</p>  
						<ul> 
							<li> 
								<p>If you share the installation options data set between HCR77A1 and pre-HCR77A1 systems, you can continue to supply the TRACEENTRY option at the lower-level systems as it is ignored, and processing will continue on the HCR77A1 systems.</p> 
							</li>  
							<li> 
								<p>If your installation cannot tolerate the CSFO0212 message that is issued at startup, you need to use different installation option data sets. Note that new CTRACE options will be in effect:</p>  
								<ul> 
									<li> 
										<p>Review the default CTRACE options to ensure that they are satisfactory for your system.</p> 
									</li>  
									<li> 
										<p>Make any necessary changes. Use the CTICSF00 PARMLIB to create customized ICSF CTRACE Configuration Data Sets in PARMLIB. You can use the new CTRACE option to specify the customized ICSF CTRACE Configuration Data Set in the ICSF Options Data Set.</p>  
										<p>For example, you can specify CTRACE(CTICSFxx), where xx is any two characters that were used when copying the default CTICSF00 parmlib member.</p>  
										<p>Component tracing is active when ICSF starts using the trace options defined in the CTICSFxx PARMLIB member, where 00 is the default. If the CTICSF00 PARMLIB member is incorrect or missing, ICSF CTRACE performs tracing using an internal default set of trace options. The operator can specify trace options individually on the TRACE CT command or specify the name of a CTICSFxx PARMLIB member containing the desired trace options. Using a PARMLIB member on the TRACE CT command can help minimize operator intervention and avoid syntax or keystroke errors</p>

						<h5 id="wq1768">Steps to take</h5>  
						<p>This information assumes that you used the installer program ( 
							<em>bin/install_ihs</em>) to install IBM HTTP Server - Powered by Apache. You must know the installation directory for the server instance, which is referred to as 
							<em>ihs-install-dir</em> in the sample commands. (This directory must be different from the product directory, usually /usr/lpp/ihsa_zos).
						</p>  
						<p>Replace the references to 
							<em>pki-install-dir</em> with the z/OS UNIX file system directory where z/OS PKI Services was installed. Usually, the directory is /usr/lpp/pkiserv/.
						</p>  
						<p>The IBM HTTP Server installer program creates the 
							<em>ihs-install-dir</em>/conf/httpd.conf configuration file that must be updated with directives provided in samples that are shipped by PKI Services and with information specific to your installation. The samples that are provided by PKI Services assume that the conf/httpd.conf contains directives that apply to each HTTP Server process, and that configuration directives for unsecure port, SSL server authentication port, and SSL client authentication port configuration are in separate configuration files that contain the &lt; VirtualHost&gt; directives that are then included in the conf/httpd.conf file. The port-specific configuration files are then included in the base conf/httpd.conf file. Follow the steps that follow to incorporate information from the PKI Services sample httpd.conf file into your conf/httpd.conf file, and to create and update the VirtualHost files specific to the PKI Services configuration.
						</p>  
						<p>Follow these steps:</p>  
						<ol> 
							<li> 
								<p>Incorporate the directives from the PKI Services sample httpd.conf file ( 
									<em>pki-install-dir</em>/samples/httpd.conf ) into the 
									<em>ihs-install-dir</em>/conf/httpd.conf configuration file.
								</p>  
								<ol> 
									<li> 
										<p>Locate the section of the conf/httpd.conffile that contains the LoadModule directives. Ensure that the following directives are specified and not commented out (a # in the first position of a line indicates that the line is a comment).</p>  
										<ul> 
											<li>LoadModule rewrite_module modules/mod_rewrite.so</li>  
											<li>LoadModule alias_module modules/mod_alias.so</li>  
											<li>LoadModule authnz_saf_module modules/mod_authnz_saf.so 
												<p>(This LoadModule directive is located after the # z/OS specific modules comment.)</p> 
											</li> 
										</ul> 
									</li>  
									<li> 
										<p>Locate the existing AddType directives in the conf/httpd.conf and add the AddType directives from the PKI Services sample httpd.conf file:</p>  
										<ul> 
											<li>AddType application/x-x509-user-cert.cer</li>  
											<li>AddType application/x-x509-ca-cert.der</li>  
											<li>AddType application/octet-stream.msi</li>  
											<li>AddType application/pkix-crl.crl</li> 
										</ul> 
									</li>  
									<li> 
										<p>Add the Include directives for the VirtualHost configuration files from the PKI Services sample httpd.conf file near the end of the conf/httpd.conf file:</p>  
										<ul> 
											<li> 
												<p>Include conf/vhost80.conf</p> 
											</li>  
											<li> 
												<p>Include conf/vhost443.conf</p> 
											</li>  
											<li> 
												<p>Include conf/vhost1443.conf</p> 
											</li> 
										</ul> Note: If you use different port numbers than 80, 443, and 1443, change the name of the files to match the port numbers that are used. For example, if you use port 1080 instead of 80 for the unsecure port, change the vhost80.conf file to vhost1080.conf. Also, make sure that the port number change is made within the vhost*.conf files. For example, change the &lt; VirtualHost *:80&gt; directive to &lt; VirtualHost *:1080&gt;.
									</li> 
								</ol> 
							</li>  
							<li> 
								<p>Copy the sample VirtualHost configuration files from the PKI Services samples directory to the 
									<em>ihs-install-dir/conf</em> directory. For example, if the 
									<em>pki-install-dir</em> is /usr/lpp/pkiserv, and the 
									<em>his-install-dir</em> is /etc/websrvissue the following command to copy the VirtualHost *:80 files:
								</p>  
								<pre> 
<code>cp /usr/lpp/pkiserv/samples/vhost*.conf /etc/websrv/conf</code>
								</pre> Note: To fully support the capabilities of PKI Services, the IBM HTTP Server powered by Domino required these instances to be running: 
								<ul> 
									<li> 
										<p>An instance for non-secure and server authentication SSL connections, and</p> 
									</li>  
									<li> 
										<p>an instance for client authentication SSL connections.</p>

								<p>The IBM HTTP Server - Powered by Apache fully supports PKI Services capabilities in a single instance using VirtualHost configuration files for non-secure, server authentication SSL, and client authentication SSL connections.</p> 
							</li>  
							<li> 
								<p>Make the following updates to each of the VirtualHost configuration files using information from the httpd.conf files from the IBM HTTP Server powered by Domino (These are referred to as the old httpd.conf files). The sample VirtualHost configuration files that are shipped with PKI Services have directives that assume the use of the PKIServ and Customers domain names. If you use different or additional domain names, you must update or add additional directives to the vhost*.conf files.</p>  
								<ol> 
									<li> 
										<p>Change all instances of &lt;server-domain-name&gt; to the fully qualified domain name of your web server. (This is in the Hostname directive value that is from the old httpd.conf files).</p> 
									</li>  
									<li> 
										<p>Change all instances of &lt;application-root&gt; to the 
											<em>pki-install-dir</em> value. ( /usr/lpp/pkiserv/ by default).
										</p> 
									</li>  
									<li> 
										<p>If you are not using the default location of /etc/pkiserv for the PKI Service configuration directory, update the SetEnv directive for _PKISERV_CONFIG_PATH with the value specified in the old httpd.conf files (as InheritEnv directives) or in the old httpd.envvars file. If additional _PKISERV_CONFIG_PATH_* environment variables are defined in your old httpd.conf or httpd.envvars files, add another SetEnv directive for each in the VirualHost configuration files.</p> 
									</li>  
									<li> 
										<p>The ScriptAliasMatch directives replace the Exec directives from the old httpd.conf files. The sample vhost*.conf files provide ScriptAliasMatch directives for the PKIServ and Customers domain names. Change or add additional ScriptAliasMatch directives based on the Exec directives from the old httpd.conf file. ( ScriptAliasMatch directives for public-cgi URLs are placed in the vhost80.conf file, ssl-cgi-bin URLs are placed in the vhost443.conf file, and clientauth-cgi-bin URLs are placed in the vhost1443.conf file).</p>  
										<p>Old httpd.conf file Exec directives:</p>  
										<pre> 
<code>Exec /PKIServ/public-cgi/* /usr/lpp/pkiserv/PKIServ/public-cgi/* Exec /Customers/public-cgi/* /usr/lpp/pkiserv/PKIServ/public-cgi/*</code>
										</pre>  
										<p>Equivalent vhost80.conf file ScriptAliasMatch directive:</p>  
										<pre> 
<code>ScriptAliasMatch /(PKIServCustomers)/public-cgi/(.*) /usr/lpp/pkiserv/PKIServ/public-cgi/$2</code>
										</pre> 
									</li>  
									<li> 
										<p>The AliasMatch directives replace the Pass directives from the old httpd.conf files. The sample vhost*.conf files provide AliasMatch directives for the PKIServ and Customers domain names. Change or add additional AliasMatch directives based on the Pass directives from the old httpd.conf file. ( AliasMatch directives for public-cgi URLs are placed in the vhost80.conf file, ssl-cgi-bin URLs are placed in the vhost443.conf file, and clientauth-cgi-bin URLs are placed in the vhost1443.conf file).</p>  
										<p>Old httpd.conf Pass directives:</p>  
										<pre> 
<code>Pass /PKIServ/cacerts/* /var/pkiserv/* Pass /PKIServ/PKIXEnroll/* /usr/lpp/pkiserv/ActiveX/PKIXEnroll/* Pass /PKIServ/PKICEnroll/* /usr/lpp/pkiserv/ActiveX/PKICEnroll/*</code>
										</pre>  
										<p>Equivalent vhost80.conf file AliasMatch directives:</p>  
										<pre> 
<code>AliasMatch /PKIServ/cacerts/(.*) /var/pkiserv/$1 AliasMatch /PKIServ/(PKIXEnrollPKICEnroll)/(.*) /usr/lpp/pkiserv/ActiveX/$1/$2</code>
										</pre> 
									</li>  
									<li> 
										<p>The Redirect directives from the old httpd.conf files are replaced with RewriteRule directives in the vhost*.conf files. If you are not using the PKIServ and Customers domain names or have additional domain names, you will need to change or create new RewriteRule directives. Also, if you are not using ports 80 and 443, the ports you are using for the non-secure and server authentication SSL must be added to the URL in the RewriteRule directives.</p>  
										<p>Old httpd.conf Redirect directive:</p>  
										<pre> 
<code>Redirect /PKIServ/ssl-cgi/* https://pokey.example.com/PKIServ/ssl-cgi-bin/* Redirect /PKIServ/ssl-cgi/auth/* https://pokey.example.com/PKIServ/ssl-cgi-bin/auth/*</code>
										</pre>  
										<p>Equivalent RewriteRule directive:</p>  
										<pre> 
<code>RewriteRule ^/(PKIServCustomers)/ssl-cgi/(.*)https://pokey.example.com/$1/ssl-cgi-bin/$2 [R,NE]</code>
										</pre> Note: This example is for redirecting from a non-secure URL to a server authentication SSL URL using the standard SSL port of 443. If a non-standard port is being used, the port number must be specified after the host name. For example, if port 4443 is used instead of 443, the URL starts with: https://pokey.example.com:4443/PKIServ/....
									</li>  
									<li> 
										<p>The Directory and DirectoryMatch directives replace the Protect and Protection directives from the old httpd.conf files. The sample vhost*.conf files provide Directory and DirectoryMatch directives for the PKIServ and Customers domain names. Change or add additional Directory and DirectoryMatch directives based on the Protect and Protection directives from the old httpd.conf file. The surrogate user ID specified in the Directory/DirectoryMatch directives is PKISERV. If you use a different surrogate user ID, you must change PKISERV to the user ID specified in the old httpd.conf files.</p> 
									</li>  
									<li> 
										<p>The LocationMatch directives in the vhost*.conf files apply specific behavior to a specific URL for the PKIServ and Customers domain names. Change or add LocationMatch directives based on the domain names in the old httpd.conf files.</p> 
									</li> 
								</ol> 
							</li>  
							<li> 
								<p>Update the vhost443.conf file to specify the keyfile value from the old httpd.conf file. (This assumes the IBM HTTP Server - Powered by Apache runs as the same USERID as the IBM HTTP Server powered by Domino.)</p>  
								<p>Old httpd.conf keyfile directive:</p>  
								<pre> 
<code>keyfile SSLring SAF</code>
								</pre>  
								<p>Equivalent keyfile directive:</p>  
								<pre> 
<code>Keyfile /saf SSLring</code>
								</pre> 
							</li>  
							<li> 
								<p>Take the following steps to update the vhost1443.conf file:</p>  
								<ol> 
									<li> 
										<p>Update the keyfile value from the value that is specified in the old httpd.conf file. (This assumes the IBM HTTP Server - Powered by Apache runs as the same USERID as the IBM HTTP Server powered by Domino.)</p>  
										<p>Old httpd.conf keyfile directive:</p>  
										<pre> 
<code>keyfile SSLring SAF</code>
										</pre>  
										<p>Equivalent keyfile directive:</p>  
										<pre> 
<code>Keyfile /saf SSLring</code>
										</pre> 
									</li>  
									<li> 
										<p>If you configured the IBM HTTP Server powered by Domino to perform revocation checking and want to continue to perform revocation checking in the IBM HTTP Server - Powered by Apache, add the following directive to the vhost1443.conf file after the SSLClientAuth directive:</p>  
										<ul> 
											<li>SSLCRLHostName 
												<p>- Set the value from the old httpd.conf file SSLX500Host directive.</p> 
											</li>  
											<li>SSLCRLPort 
												<p>- Set the value from the old httpd.conf file SSLX500Port directive.</p> 
											</li>  
											<li>SSLCRLUserID 
												<p>- Set the value from the old httpd.conf file SSLX500UserID directive.</p> 
											</li>  
											<li>SSLStashfile 
												<p>- Set the value from the old httpd.conf file SSLX500Password directive.</p> Note: SSLStashfile is the fully qualified path to the file that contains the password for the user name on the LDAP server. This directive is not required for an anonymous bind. Use it when you specify a user ID. Use the 
												<strong>sslstash</strong> command, which is in the bin directory of IBM HTTP Server, to create your CRL password stash file. Specify the password that you use to log in to your LDAP server as the password on the 
												<strong>sslstash</strong> command. The format of the 
												<strong>sslstash</strong> command is: 
												<pre> 
<code>sslstash [-c]
	<em>file</em>
	<em>function</em>
	<em>password</em>
</code>
												</pre>  
												<p>where:</p>  
												<dl> 
													<dt>-c</dt>  
													<dd> 
														<p>Creates a new stash file. If not specified, an existing file is updated.</p> 
													</dd>  
													<dt> 
														<em>file</em> 
													</dt>  
													<dd> 
														<p>Is the fully qualified name of the file to create or update.</p> 
													</dd>  
													<dt> 
														<em>function</em> 
													</dt>  
													<dd> 
														<p>Indicates the function for which the password is to be used. Valid values include crl and crypto.</p> 
													</dd>  
													<dt> 
														<em>password</em> 
													</dt>  
													<dd> 
														<p>Is the password to stash.</p>

					<title>DFSMSdfp: Back up SMS control data sets</title>  
					<description><![CDATA[  
						<h5 id="wq1778">Description</h5>  
						<p>In a multisystem Storage Management Subsystem (SMS) complex, operating systems share a common set of SMS classes, groups, ACS routines, and a configuration base, which make up the storage management policy for the complex. This storage management policy is maintained in a source control data set (SCDS). When this policy is activated for SMS, the bound policy is maintained in processor storage and on DASD in an active control data set (ACDS). Systems in the complex communicate SMS information through a common communications data set (COMMDS).</p>  
						<p>It is recommended that to successfully share SMS control data sets in a multisystem environment where there are mixed levels of DFSMS, you update, translate, validate, and activate SMS policies on the system with the latest level of DFSMS. When an earlier control data set is to be updated or activated, the control data set is formatted by the later-level system. The shared SMS control blocks reflect the new, rather than the previous, lengths and control information.</p>  
						<p>For fallback, IBM recommends restoring SMS control data sets from backups taken on the fallback release.</p>  
						<p>Editing a policy on an earlier system could invalidate unused control information and prevent the control data set from being accessed by a later system. A warning message is provided before a policy can be changed on an earlier system. ACS routines may need to be updated and translated so to not reference policy items not known to the earlier system.</p>  
						<p>Remember, you risk policy activation failures if SCDS changes are not validated using the latest-level system in a sysplex.</p>

You can then re-run this Workflow step to submit the health check job again, until the health check no longer receives an exception and the step is marked "Complete".</p>  
							<p>This health check has been introduced in z/OS V2.2. If you attempt to run this step on a pre-V2.2 system, it will not be found. Once you have migrated to z/OS V2.2, you can run this check.</p>

					<title>DFSMSdfp: Adjust parameters to control whether offline device discovery is performed</title>  
					<description><![CDATA[  
						<h5 id="wq1865">Description</h5>  
						<p>Beginning in APAR OA43706 (PTFs: UA74649 for z/OS V2R1 and UA74648 for z/OS V1R13), the System Data Mover (ANTAS000 address space) is changed to conditionally invoke offline device discovery during IPL. Prior to this APAR, offline device discovery was always performed.</p>  
						<p>APAR OA43706 introduced a new keyword called OfflineDiscovery to the ANTXIN00 parmlib member to allow you to control whether offline device discovery is performed during IPL when ANTAS000 first starts up, and thereafter when ANTAS000 restarts following a CANCEL. A value of YES causes offline discovery to take place. A value of NO bypasses offline device discovery. If OfflineDiscovery is not specified, the default is OfflineDiscovery(NO).</p> Tip: The Offline Device Discovery was introduced by APAR OA36570 (PTFs for z/OS V1R12 and V1R13) and incorporated into z/OS V2R1 to reduce the XSTART time following an IPL. 
						<p>SYSLOG messages example:</p>  
						<pre> 
<code>ANTB8000I XRC INITIALIZATION STARTED ANTB8002I OFFLINE DEVICE DISCOVERY COMPLETE; RC=0 REAS=606 ANTB8001I XRC INITIALIZATION COMPLETED</code>

						<p>You should only need to perform offline device discovery during IPL (that is, specify OfflineDiscovery(YES) in ANTXIN00) if you are using one of the following:</p>  
						<ul> 
							<li> 
								<p>GDPS MzGM (aka XRC) in HYPER-PPRC mode (Incremental Resynch)</p> 
							</li>  
							<li> 
								<p>GDPS MzGM under z/OS with XRC Offline Primary devices</p> 
							</li> 
						</ul>  
						<p>Other XRC configurations or non-XRC environments will not directly benefit from having offline discovery performed at IPL. Therefore, if it is not required, do not specify the keyword and avoid discovery, which may reduce overall IPL elapsed time.</p> Tip: The value of OfflineDiscovery takes effect when the ANTAS000 address space is started during IPL, or with the automatic restart of ANTAS000 after it has been cancelled. To activate a new value for OfflineDiscovery without an IPL, do the following: 
						<ol> 
							<li> 
								<p>Update the value in PARMLIB member ANTXIN00</p> 
							</li>  
							<li> 
								<p>Issue the system command CANCEL ANTAS000</p> 
							</li> 
						</ol>  
						<p>The OfflineDiscovery keyword is ignored and will not be processed if it is specified in the ALL or session member of hlq.XCOPY.PARMLIB.</p>

					<title>DFSMSdfp: Accommodate change for data set name prefix in IDCAMS ALLOCATE</title>  
					<description><![CDATA[  
						<h5 id="wq1896">Description</h5>  
						<p>With IDCAMS APAR OA42679 and TSO/E APAR OA43330 applied, the 
							<strong>IDCAMS ALLOCATE</strong> command is changed in the way that it starts TSO/E to allocate a data set. IDCAMS processing now uses the TSO/E Service Facility (TSF) to allocate a data set, rather than running the 
							<strong>ALLOCATE</strong> command under the TSO/E terminal monitor program (IKJEFT01). With this change, the user ID assigned to the IDCAMS batch job is treated as the default data set prefix. That is, the user ID for the IDCAMS batch job is appended to the data set name as a high-level qualifier, if you specify the data set name on the DATASET keyword without quotation marks and the user ID does not have a RACF TSO segment.
						</p>  
						<p>Previously, the 
							<strong>IDCAMS ALLOCATE</strong> command used a null prefix for the allocated data set, if you specified the data set name on the DATASET keyword without quotation marks and the user ID did not have a RACF TSO segment.
						</p>  
						<p>Assume, for example, that the user ID ZZZZZZZ is defined in both UADS and in RACF without a TSO segment; note the following differences in behavior:</p>  
						<ul> 
							<li> 
								<p>Before this change, TSO runs under the UADS user. If the data set name is specified without quotation marks on the DATASET keyword, and the user has a UADS PROFILE PREFIX( 
									<em>prefix</em>), the prefix is used as the data set prefix. Otherwise, the user ID is used as the data set prefix.
								</p> 
							</li>  
							<li> 
								<p>After this change, the user ID is always used as the data set prefix. Therefore, if the user ID and UADS PROFILE PREFIX( 
									<em>prefix</em>) are different, the high-level qualifier for the data set is changed.

					<title>DFSMSdfp: Accommodate new authorization requirements for users of the IDCAMS DEFINE command</title>  
					<description><![CDATA[  
						<h5 id="wq1910">Description</h5>  
						<p>IDCAMS APAR OA47269 introduces changes to the RACF authorization checking of data set aliases, VSAM cluster paths, and alternate indexes (AIXs). As a result of this change, users of the 
							<strong>IDCAMS DEFINE</strong> command might require additional security authorizations for defining these objects.
						</p>  
						<p>In previous releases:</p>  
						<ul> 
							<li> 
								<p>For a 
									<strong>DEFINE ALIAS</strong> request, if the alias was for a generation data set or a non-VSAM data set, the generation data set name or the non-VSAM data set name was used for RACF authorization checking
								</p> 
							</li>  
							<li> 
								<p>For a 
									<strong>DEFINE ALTERNATEINDEX</strong> or 
									<strong>DEFINE PATH</strong> request, the associated cluster name was used for RACF authorization checking.
								</p> 
							</li> 
						</ul>  
						<p>With IDCAMS APAR OA47269 applied, the user of the 
							<strong>IDCAMS DEFINE</strong> command requires SAF ALTER authority:
						</p>  
						<ul> 
							<li> 
								<p>To the target data set when defining an alias for the data set. This requirement is added to the existing requirement that users have SAF UPDATE authority to the catalog that is to contain the alias, if the associated data set is non-SMS-managed. If the associated data set is SMS-managed, no SAF authority is required.</p> 
							</li>  
							<li> 
								<p>To the VSAM cluster, when defining a VSAM path or alternate index name (AIX) for the cluster. This requirement is added to the existing requirement that users have SAF UPDATE authority to the catalog, if the related cluster is not SMS-managed.</p> 
							</li> 
						</ul>

						<h5 id="wq2030">Steps to take</h5>  
						<p>Because SMB is dependent on the threading model that was in effect before the PTFs for APAR OA39909 and APAR OA43472 were installed, you need to take the following steps:</p>  
						<ol> 
							<li> 
								<p>To allow SMB to use the original threading behavior, add the environment variable _BPXK_UNUSEDTASKS=KEEP to the SMB DFSCNTL environment file, which is typically found in the /opt/dfslocal/home/dfscntl/envar directory.</p> 
							</li>  
							<li> 
								<p>If SMB is started, it must be stopped and restarted using the C DFS and S DFS commands.</p> 
							</li> 
						</ol>  
						<p>After you complete the steps, SMB will use the original threading behavior that was in place prior to the PTF for APAR OA39909.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[  
						<h5 id="wq2050">Description</h5>  
						<p>Historically, when a SYSPUNCH or SYSLIN data set is created by HLASM on z/OS and the BLKSIZE parameter is either not specified or specified with a value of 0, HLASM will create a data set which has a BLKSIZE equal to the LRECL value. This is typically not an optimal BLKSIZE value and may result in a poorly performing data set.</p>  
						<p>By the enhancement of APAR PI10515 (PTF UI15579 for z/OS V2R1, V1R13, and V1R12), HLASM has been modified not to set the default BLKSIZE to LRECL if a block size of zero is supplied for SYSLIN and SYSPUNCH data sets. HLASM will now leave the BLKSIZE as zero to allow DFSMS to determine the block size based upon the its criteria.</p> Note: When system-determined block sizes (SDBs) are used for SYSLIN data sets, the data set may be created with a larger block size than supported by the HEWLKED linkage editor.

						<p>When you invoke the linkage editor (HEWLKED) rather than the Binder (IEWBLINK), the maximum block size of data sets defined in the SYSLIN definition is 3200 bytes. After the HLASM APAR PI10515 (PTF UI15579), when the BLKSIZE is not supplied to the SYSLIN data set in the ASM step, it is created with large block size (for example, 27920) by the SDB. The old linkage editor does not accept the block size larger than 3200, which results in the following error message:</p>  
						<pre> 
<code>CC16.IEW0594 ERROR - INPUT DATA SET BLOCKSIZE IS INVALID</code>
						</pre>  
						<p>To avoid using SDB when invoking the HEWLKED linkage editor, you need to supply a BLKSIZE of 3200 or less (which is a multiple of the LRECL) in the SYSLIN data set in ASM step.</p>

							<h5 id="ihsdominoremoval__stepstotake">Steps to take</h5>  
							<p>In z/OS V2R2, you must migrate to IBM HTTP Server - Powered by Apache, which is included as a base element of z/OS. It is recommended that you perform this migration in two phases, as follows:</p>  
							<ol> 
								<li> 
									<p>Before you install z/OS V2R2, use the separate licensed program z/OS Ported Tools HTTP Server feature (5655-M23) on z/OS V2R1 or z/OS V1R13. You can run the IBM Ported Tools HTTP Server and the IBM HTTP Server powered by Domino concurrently, if necessary, for certain functions that do not support the IBM Ported Tools HTTP Server on z/OS V2R1 or z/OS V1R13, such as Infoprint Server at those release levels (see "Infoprint migration action for HTTP Server").</p>  
									<p>In this phase of the migration, you can perform much of the migration work for z/OS V2R2 IBM HTTP Server in advance and stabilize on IBM HTTP Server - Powered by Apache. The z/OS Ported Tools HTTP Server feature is at level 8.5.5 (Apache V2.2.8 level).</p> 
								</li>  
								<li> 
									<p>After you install z/OS V2R2, migrate from z/OS Ported Tools HTTP Server feature to z/OS V2R2 IBM HTTP Server - Powered by Apache. In z/OS V2R2, IBM HTTP Server - Powered by Apache is at the 9.0 level (based on Apache V2.4). Here, you need only to perform the migration actions between IBM HTTP Server 8.5.5 and 9.0, which are fewer than the number of migration actions that are needed to move from IBM HTTP Server powered by Domino directly to IBM HTTP Server - Powered by Apache at the 9.0 level.</p> 
								</li> 
							</ol> Note: To avoid an error (condition code 0137 and ABENDU4093 RC00000281) ensure that REGION=0M is specified on the EXEC statement of the IBM HTTP Server started procedure. APAR PI47828 (Apache 8.5.5) and APAR PI50373 (Apache 9.0) updates the sample procedure to specify REGION=0M and TIME=NOLIMIT.

						<instructions>This portion of the Workflow will guide you to submit a job to run an IBM Health Check for z/OS associated with this migration action, 
							<strong>IBMZMIG,ZOSMIG_HTTP_SERVER_DOMINO</strong>. 
							<p>This check will be activated if it is not already active. If the check is activated, it will be deactivated at the end of the job, so that it remains in the same state as it was found.</p>  
							<p>If the health check runs with no exception, this step will be marked "Complete" indicating that this migration action requires no more activity.</p>  
							<p>If the health check finds an exception, this step will be marked as "Failed". This tells you that further investigation (and possibly more work) is necessary to complete this migration action. If the step is marked "Failed", you should review the health check output (via any method you use to view health check output, such as SDSF) and correct any situation that you find appropriate. You can then re-run this Workflow step to submit the health check job again, until the health check no longer receives an exception and the step is marked "Complete".</p>  
							<p>This health check is not provided in an APAR. If you perform this step and the results are that this health check is not found, then add it to your system with the instructions found on the web page http://www-03.ibm.com/systems/z/os/zos/installation/midownloads.html .

					<description><![CDATA[  
						<h5 id="wq2117">Description</h5>  
						<p>In previous releases of z/OSMF, the generated program

						</p>  
						<pre> 
<code>
	<em>&lt;SAF-prefix&gt;</em>. ZOSMF.**
</code>
						</pre>  
						<p>where 
							<em>&lt;SAF-prefix&gt;</em> is the SAF profile prefix that was defined for your configuration (by default, IZUDFLT). If you used 
							<strong>izuconfig1.cfg.rexx</strong> in a previous release, this generic profile was created for your configuration.
						</p>  
						<p>As of z/OS V2R2, the z/OSMF configuration process no longer creates authorizations based on this most-generic profile. Instead, authorizations are now created based on the following discrete generic profile:</p>  
						<pre> 
<code>
	<em>&lt;SAF-prefix&gt;</em>. ZOSMF
</code>
						</pre>  
						<p>In this release, a sample job is provided in SYS1.SAMPLIB(IZUSEC) to help you create the resource names and security authorizations for z/OSMF. Your security administrator can edit and run this job to secure various resources on the z/OS system.</p>  
						<p>For the profiles and permissions that are created, see the contents of the IZUSEC sample job.</p>

						<p>To display a subset of the items in a table in the IBM z/OS Management Facility (z/OSMF) user interface, you must define filter rules that show only the items in which you are interested. Before z/OS V2R2, the filter rules you set were saved and reapplied for subsequent views of the table. Starting with z/OS V2R2, z/OSMF provides a modern, intuitive interface that is consistent with other IBM products. The enhanced user interface does not support the filter rules that were preserved in previous z/OSMF releases; therefore, when you display a table in z/OSMF V2R2, you might see more data or different data than you are accustom to seeing. To show only the items in which you are interested, recreate the filter rules you set in previous releases of z/OSMF.</p>

					<title>ICKDSF: Accommodate new default for INIT and REFORMAT commands</title>  
					<description><![CDATA[  
						<h5 id="wq2147">Description</h5>  
						<p>The VERIFYOFFLINE parameter of the INIT and REFORMAT commands verifies that the device is offline to all other systems before the command is attempted. Beginning with ICKDSF APAR PI25913, if the UNIT parameter is specified for the INIT or REFORMAT command, and the required storage control microcode support and software support exists, and the device is not a minidisk, the VERIFYOFFLINE parameter is the default, meaning that verification that the device is offline occurs even if VERIFYOFFLINE is not specified. Prior to ICKDSF APAR PI25913, verification occurred only when VERIFYOFFLINE was specified.</p>  
						<p>If the VERIFYOFFLINE parameter is processed as the default, and the device is online to another system, the command terminates, with message ICK31306I in the job output.</p>  
						<p>To request that verification not take place, you can use a new NOVERIFYOFFLINE parameter.</p> Note: The VERIFYOFFLINE parameter of the INIT and REFORMAT commands was introduced by ICKDSF APAR PM76231

					<title>Discontinue use of the Infoprint Server SNMP subagent</title>  
					<description><![CDATA[  
						<h5 id="wq2162">Description</h5>  
						<p>In z/OS V2R2, the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) subagent is no longer provided with Infoprint Server, so you must take steps to stop using it. The SNMP subagent lets network management systems (such as Ricoh Network Printer Manager for the web) communicate with PSF-controlled printers that do not have internal SNMP agents. However, because most newer printers contain internal SNMP agents, network management systems can communicate directly with these printers.</p>  
						<p>As an alternative to using a network management system to monitor PSF-controlled printers, you can use Infoprint Central, a web-based print management system. Infoprint Central can display the status of all your PSF-controlled printers. In addition, Infoprint Central lets you stop and start the printers, change printer work-selection criteria, and turn TCP/IP-connected printers online and offline.</p>

								<ul> 
									<li> 
										<p>Configure the network management system to communicate with the printers directly.</p> 
									</li>  
									<li> 
										<p>Use Infoprint Central to manage the printers. To use Infoprint Central, you must customize PSF to use the Infoprint Server Printer Inventory.</p>

								</ul> 
							</li>  
							<li> 
								<p>Stop the SNMP subagent daemon:</p>  
								<ol> 
									<li> 
										<p>(Optional) Edit the Infoprint Server configuration file ( aopd.conf) to remove the 
											<strong>snmp</strong> value from the 
											<strong>start-daemons</strong> attribute. This step is optional because Infoprint Server will ignore the 
											<strong>snmp</strong> value.
										</p> 
									</li>  
									<li> 
										<p>If Infoprint Server is running, stop the SNMP subagent daemon ( 
											<strong>aopsnmpd</strong>). For example, enter this MVS START command to run the AOPSTOP procedure to stop daemon

							<p>Follow these steps:</p>  
							<ul> 
								<li> 
									<p>After migrating to z/OS V1R11 JES2, or later, on all systems in your MAS, determine your z11 checkpoint activation readiness:</p>  
									<ol> 
										<li> 
											<p>Use the $D ACTIVATE command. This command indicates if activation to z11 mode will succeed.</p> 
										</li>  
										<li> 
											<p>Review your current utilization of BERT data to determine if there are sufficient BERTS, as detailed in 
												<a href="#checkbert">Check BERT utilization</a>.
											</p> 
										</li>  
										<li> 
											<p>If you issue the $ACTIVATE,LEVEL=z11 command, activation of LARGEDS support is required.</p> 
										</li>  
										<li> 
											<p>An additional nnn 4K records for CKPT1 is required for z11 mode.</p> 
										</li> 
									</ol> 
								</li>  
								<li> 
									<p>Run the JES2 $ACTIVATE command to verify non-configuration changes that must be accommodated before going to z11, and to activate z11 mode following the considerations for this command found in 
										<cite>z/OS JES2 Commands</cite>.
									</p> Note: The SPOOLDEF LARGEDS=FAIL (default value) in JES2PARM parmlib member is not supported in z11 mode. In z11 mode, on a COLD start, JES2 defaults to LARGEDS=ALLOWED. However, you cannot issue the $ACTIVATE,LEVEL=z11 command in the environment of SPOOLDEF LARGEDS=FAIL.
								</li> 
							</ul>  
							<p>By default, JES2 V1R13 and V2R1 restart in the same mode (z2 or z11) as other members of the MAS (if any are active) or the mode the last active JES2 member was in when it came down. To restart JES2 in z2 mode, specify UNACT on PARM=. On a cold start, JES2 starts in z11 mode unless overridden by OPTSDEF COLD_START_MODE or UNACT parameter.</p>

								</li> 
							</ul>  
							<h5 id="checkbert">Check BERT utilization</h5>  
							<p>Before issuing the $ACTIVATE,LEVEL=z11 command, review the current utilization of BERT data to determine whether there are sufficient BERTs. Additional BERTs are needed for each SYSOUT data set that has transaction data associated with it. These SYSOUT data sets can be seen using SDSF by setting APPC ON and examining SYSOUT data sets on the H and O panels; SYSOUT data sets with transaction data have nontraditional JES2 job IDs. Consider increasing the number of BERTs to correspond to two times the maximum number of transaction SYSOUT data sets on the system. BERT utilization should be monitored after the $ACTIVATE to z11 mode to ensure there are sufficient BERTs for the jobs and SYSOUT in the MAS. There are several ways to determine your current BERT usage.</p>  
							<ul> 
								<li> 
									<p>The $D CKPTSPACE,BERTUSE command displays a table of the types of control blocks in BERTs and how many BERTs are used by each control block type. The example shows the output of the command:</p>  
									<pre> 
<code>$HASP852 CKPTSPACE CURRENT BERT UTILIZATION $HASP852 TYPE COUNT CB COUNT $HASP852 -------- --------- --------- $HASP852 INTERNAL 11 1 $HASP852 JQE 211 108 $HASP852 CAT 114 38 $HASP852 WSCQ 1 1 $HASP852 DJBQ 0 0 $HASP852 JOE 0 0 $HASP852 FREE 763 0</code>
									</pre>  
									<p>In the example, there are 108 JQEs that have a total of 211 BERTs associated with them. This example is for a system in z2 mode and does not have any BERTs associated with JOEs.</p> 
								</li>  
								<li> 
									<p>The $D ACTIVATE command displays the number of BERTs that are needed for activation to z11 mode. This is the number of BERTs that will be associated with JOEs after the $ACTIVATE. The example shows the output of the $D ACTIVATE command:</p>  
									<pre> 
<code>$HASP895 $DACTIVATE $HASP895 JES2 CHECKPOINT MODE IS CURRENTLY Z2 $HASP895 THE CURRENT CHECKPOINT: $HASP895 -- CONTAINS 1100 BERTS AND BERT UTILIZATION IS 30 $HASP895 PERCENT. $HASP895 -- CONTAINS 158 4K RECORDS. $HASP895 z11 CHECKPOINT MODE ACTIVATION WILL: $HASP895 -- EXPAND CHECKPOINT SIZE TO 165 4K RECORDS. $HASP895 -- REQUIRE 22 ADDITIONAL BERTS AND UTILIZATION $HASP895 WOULD REACH 32 PERCENT. $HASP895 z11 ACTIVATION WILL SUCCEED IF ISSUED FROM THIS MEMBER.</code>
									</pre>  
									<p>In the example, there are 22 additional BERTs that will be used after the $ACTIVATE to z11 mode, for transaction data associated with JOEs.</p> Note: When the SPOOLDEF LARGEDS=FAIL (default value) is in effect in your JES2PARM parmlib member, the following message will be issued by the $ACTIVATE command: 
									<pre> 
<code>$HASP895 z11 ACTIVATION WILL FAIL IF ISSUED FROM THIS MEMBER. $HASP895 THE FOLLOWING ISSUES PREVENT ACTIVATION: $HASP895 -- LARGEDS SUPPORT MUST BE ACTIVATED.</code>
									</pre> 
								</li>  
								<li> 
									<p>A general history of BERT usage can be obtained by using the $JD HISTORY(BERT) command or by using the SDSF RM panel. This displays the usage of BERTs after the system was IPLed. The following example shows the output of the $JD HISTORY(BERT) command:</p>  
									<pre> 
<code>$HASP9130 D HISTORY $HASP9131 JES2 BERT USAGE HISTORY DATE TIME LIMIT USAGE LOW HIGH AVERAGE -------- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------- 2009.086 16:00:00 1100 337 337 337 337 2009.086 15:50:09 1100 337 125 337 192</code>

							<h5 id="wq2298">Description</h5>  
							<p>Before z/OS V2R2, if data set integrity (DSI) was specified for the JES3 programs IATINTK or IATINTKF in your SCHEDxx parmlib member, ENQs would occur, but only for batch allocation of JES3 data sets that were identified in the JES3 start procedure with DD statements. If you did not specify IATINTK or IATINTKF in SCHEDxx, no ENQs would occur. The reason is that the value of NODSI for IATINTK and IATINTKF is coded in the IBM-supplied Program Properties Table (PPT, or IEFSDPPT). NODSI remains coded in IEFSDPPT in z/OS V2R2, as was done in previous releases.</p>  
							<p>Starting with z/OS V2R2, if you override the IBM-supplied PPT with a SCHEDxx entry of DSI for IATINTK or IATINTKF, ENQs occur for batch allocations of JES3 data sets identified in the JES3 start procedure with DD statements (as in previous releases). In addition, JES3 now also obtains ENQs for all dynamic allocations of JES3 data sets.</p>  
							<p>It is recommended that you take advantage of DSI protection by specifying DSI for IATINTK and IATINTKF in your SCHEDxx member. The SCHEDxx default when you specify a program name, is that the program name has DSI. Thus, if you do not specify any DSI value (DSI or NODSI) for a SCHEDxx program name, the program receives DSI protection. Therefore, it is recommended that you explicitly code a value of DSI in the SCHEDxx member for IATINTK and IATINTKF to avoid any confusion over which value is being used.</p>  
							<p>You can use the following PPT statements to add the DSI specification to SCHEDxx and maintain the attributes from the IBM-supplied default entries:</p>  
							<pre> 
<code>PPT PGMNAME(IATINTK) NOCANCEL NOSWAP SYST DSI KEY(1) NOHONORIEFUSIREGION PPT PGMNAME(IATINTKF) NOSWAP SYST DSI KEY(1)</code>

							<strong>IBMJES3,JES3_DATASET_INTEGRITY</strong>. 
							<p>This check will be activated if it is not already active. If the check is activated, it will be deactivated at the end of the job, so that it remains in the same state as it was found.</p>  
							<p>If the health check runs with no exception, this step will be marked "Complete" indicating that this migration action requires no more activity.</p>  
							<p>If the health check finds an exception, this step will be marked as "Failed". This tells you that further investigation (and possibly more work) is necessary to complete this migration action. If the step is marked "Failed", you should review the health check output (via any method you use to view health check output, such as SDSF) and correct any situation that you find appropriate. You can then re-run this Workflow step to submit the health check job again, until the health check no longer receives an exception and the step is marked "Complete".</p>  
							<p>This health check has been introduced in z/OS V2.2. If you attempt to run this step on a pre-V2.2 system, it will not be found. Once you have migrated to z/OS V2.2, you can run this check.</p>

						<p>Starting with z/OS V2R2, the JES3 macro IATYLRS fixed entry is extended to support new generation data group (GDG) limits greater than 255. This change allows up to 999 active GDSs. The new format is called GDG Extended (GDGE). To support 999 active GDSs, the size of a JES3 Locator Response (LRS) fixed entry is extended and a new 2-byte GDG limit field is added.</p>  
						<p>Flag byte LRSFLG2 contains a new flag that indicates when an LRS with an extended fixed entry is used:</p>  
						<p>LRSFIXEX EQU     X'04'     LRS extended fixed entry is used</p>  
						<p>The LRS fixed entry size is being extended from 12 bytes as represented by the equate LRSFXLEN. Two fields are defined in the extended fixed entry:</p>  
						<p>LRSXFXLN DS      H       Length of LRS fixed entry LRSGDLME DS     H       GDG limit from catalog management (GDGLIMTE)</p>  
						<p>When flag LRSFIXEX is set, the extended format of the LRS fixed entry is present and the value of field LRSXFXLN should be used for the length of the LRS fixed entry. Otherwise, the previous format of the LRS fixed entry is present and the existing equate LRSFXLEN is used for the length.</p>  
						<p>When existing flag LRSGDG is set, the LRS entry is for a GDG ALL request with a GDG limit value provided. When LRSFIXEX is set, the value of field LRSGDLME will contain the 2-byte GDG limit. Existing field LRSGDLIM is maintained and is set to the lesser of 255 and the value in LRSGDLME. When LRSFIXEX is not set, the value of field LRSGDLIM will contain the 1-byte GDG limit.</p>

						<p>Review Language Environment load modules in the LPA.</p>  
						<p>To move load modules into the LPA, use the following sample members in the CEE.SCEESAMP data set:</p>  
						<ul> 
							<li> 
								<em>AFHWMLP2</em>  
								<p>: This is a sample of all Language Environment Fortran component modules eligible for the LPA.</p> 
							</li>  
							<li> 
								<em>CEEWLPA</em>  
								<p>: This is a sample of a PROG xx member of SYS1.PARMLIB that includes all Language Environment CEE-prefixed runtime modules eligible for the LPA (that is, all Language Environment base modules) except the callable services stubs.</p> 
							</li>  
							<li> 
								<em>CELQWLPA</em>  
								<p>: This is a sample for AMODE 64 runtime support.</p> 
							</li>  
							<li> 
								<em>EDCWLPA</em>  
								<p>: This is a sample of a PROG xx member of SYS1.PARMLIB that includes all Language Environment EDC-prefixed and CEH-prefixed runtime modules eligible for the LPA (that is, all XL C/C++ component modules) except locales and code page converters.</p> 
							</li>  
							<li> 
								<em>IBMALLP2 (or IBMPLPA1 for Enterprise PL/I for z/OS)</em>  
								<p>: This is a sample of all Language Environment PL/I component modules eligible for the LPA.</p> 
							</li>  
							<li> 
								<em>IGZWMLP4</em>  
								<p>: This is a sample of all Language Environment COBOL component modules eligible for the LPA.</p> 
							</li> 
						</ul>  
						<p>To see which modules are eligible for the LPA, refer to 
							<cite>z/OS Language Environment Customization</cite>. The modules listed there can be put in the LPA or extended LPA (ELPA) depending on their RMODE value:
						</p>  
						<ul> 
							<li> 
								<p>If the RMODE is ANY, the module can reside in the LPA or in the ELPA (above or below the 16 MB line).</p> 
							</li>  
							<li> 
								<p>If the RMODE is 24, the module can reside only in the LPA (below the 16 MB line).</p> 
							</li> 
						</ul>  
						<p>If you are considering placing the modules listed in 
							<cite>z/OS Language Environment Customization</cite> in the LPA or the ELPA, then IBM recommends that you place the SCEELPA data set in the LPA list (LPALST xx ). SCEELPA contains Language Environment load modules that are reentrant, that reside above the 16 MB line, and that are heavily used by z/OS.
						</p>  
						<p>In 
							<cite>z/OS Language Environment Customization</cite> you will also see tables of modules eligible for the LPA and the ELPA above and beyond what is found in the SCEELPA data set. You will need to use the dynamic LPA or MLPA approach to move these modules into the LPA or ELPA. You do not need to include recommended modules if they contain functions your installation does not use. Language Environment modules not listed in these tables can be moved into the LPA or ELPA at your discretion.

						<h5 id="wq2370">Description</h5>  
						<p>The Library Server configuration files ( bookmgr.80, booksrv.80) contain information about your environment and preferences. The information in bookmgr.80 includes the names of bookshelf lists for bookshelves in z/OS data sets and the names of the file system directories that Library Server reads and writes during execution. The information in booksrv.80 includes the file system directory names of book collections, shelves, and bookcases, as well as product option settings configured via the Library Server Administration Page. There are default values but normally you would customize them. In order to bring the customized values over to your new system, you have to copy them. (Note that port number suffix .80, used in bookmgr.80 and booksrv.80, is an example. Your port number suffix might be different.)</p>

						<p>Copy your current (customized) configuration files, usually bookmgr.80 and booksrv.80, to your new system and add any configuration parameters that are new since the z/OS release from which you are migrating. Otherwise Library Server will run with default values, not the values you're used to. A suggested (but not required) place for these configuration files is /etc/booksrv. Library Server will also search /etc and the original cgi-bin for them. If you place the files in any other directory, use the EPHConfigPath environment variable to tell Library Server where to find them.</p>

							<li> 
								<p>All 
									<strong>Exec</strong> directives are required to become 
									<strong>ScriptAlias</strong> directives in conf/httpd.conf.

							<li> 
								<p>Multiple port support is configured in a single conf/httpd.conf using the VirtualHost directive, such as 
									<strong>&lt;VirtualHost *:8080&gt;</strong>.
								</p> 
							</li>  
							<li> 
								<p>A 
									<strong>Listen port#</strong> directive must be specified for each port (default and VirtualHost) configured in conf/httpd.conf.
								</p> 
							</li>  
							<li> 
								<p>A 
									<strong>&lt;LocationMatch&gt;</strong> directive is required in conf/httpd.conf to prevent EBCDIC to ASCII translation when downloading CSS files.
								</p> 
							</li>  
							<li> 
								<p>If configuring an SSL port in conf/httpd.conf, the 
									<strong>LoadModule ibm_ssl_module modules/mod_ibm_ssl.so</strong> directive must be enabled.
								</p> 
							</li>  
							<li> 
								<p>A self-identifying 
									<strong>ServerName</strong> directive, such as ServerName MYMVS.ibm.com:80, should be specified in conf/httpd.conf.
								</p> 
							</li>  
							<li> 
								<p>Other directives such as

									<strong>CustomLog</strong>, and 
									<strong>ServerAdmin</strong> should be configured as needed in conf/httpd.conf.
								</p> 
							</li> 
						</ol>  
						<p>Add the new directives mentioned here to the conf/httpd.conf file that is installed with IBM HTTP Server - Powered by Apache, and base them on the corresponding directives, if applicable, from your conf/httpd.conf file that was previously used with IBM HTTP Server powered by Domino.

						<p>Follow these steps:</p>  
						<ul> 
							<li> 
								<p>If you have used the RMF Monitor III utility to modify any of the four Monitor III reporter session phases, search the programs or applications provided as user exits for these Monitor III phases for fields from the RMF Monitor III tabular report data tables ERBZFST3 and ERBZFAT3.</p>  
								<p>Likewise, look for Monitor III reports that have been modified or created with the Monitor III utility that make use of any of the fields in ERBZFST3 or ERBZFAT3.</p>  
								<p>The RMF Monitor III tabular report data tables ERBZFST3 and ERBZFAT3 will be empty (the tables exist, but contain no data) when running RMF Monitor III in V2R2, because zFS performance data will be stored to ERBZFOT3 and ERBZFFT3. Programs or applications using values from ERBZFST3 or ERBZFAT3 will always find empty fields (no data contained).</p>  
								<p>To access zFS performance data with your existing user exits or modified Monitor III reports, you must use ZFSOVW and ZFSFS instead of ZFSSUM and ZFSACT. You must also replace the field names from ERBZFST3 and ERBZFAT3 you have identified in the previous step with the corresponding fields from ERBZFOT3 and ERBZFFT3.</p> 
							</li>  
							<li> 
								<p>Look for applications requesting ZFSSUM or ZFSACT data from the RMF Distributed Data Server using the HTTP API (a request for a complete ZFSSUM or ZFSACT report or requests for metrics based on one of these reports), such as:</p>  
								<pre> 
<code>http://hostname:8803/gpm/reports/ZFSSUM?resource=",S4,MVS_IMAGE"</code>

								</pre>  
								<p>HTTP applications requesting data based on ZFSSUM or ZFSACT will receive an HTTP response containing a GPM0630I message stating that no data is available for this request. Therefore HTTP applications must be changed to use requests for ZFSOVW or ZFSFS reports and requests for metrics based on these reports, if you want to monitor zFS performance data.</p>

						<h5 id="wq2441">Description</h5>  
						<p>To avoid problems when reporting Monitor III data, use an RMF reporter version that is equal to or later than the latest RMF gatherer version used to collect the data to be reported. For example, it is safe to use an RMF reporter version from z/OS V2R2 for data collected with an RMF gatherer from z/OS V1R13, but not vice versa.</p>  
						<p>Mixed (and therefore problematic) levels of collected data can occur in the following scenarios:</p>  
						<ul> 
							<li> 
								<em>Single system</em>  
								<p>: You install and test a new release, then fall back to an earlier one; your data sets might contain data collected with different versions of the RMF gatherer.</p> 
							</li>  
							<li> 
								<em>Sysplex</em>  
								<p>: You migrate to a new release on one system in a sysplex but try to use an earlier reporter version from another system to report on the migrated system's data.</p>

							<h5 id="wq2483">Steps to take</h5>  
							<p>If you are already using dynamic statements for ISFPARMS, there is no migration action to perform.</p>  
							<p>If you are using assembler macros for ISFPARMS, do one of the following:</p>  
							<ul> 
								<li> 
									<p>Convert your existing ISFPARMS to dynamic statements by using a conversion utility that you invoke with the ISFACP command.</p> 
								</li>  
								<li> 
									<p>Reassemble your customized ISFPARMS for use with z/OS V2R2. Reassembly must be done whenever you change your z/OS release. Before reassembling ISFPARMS, you might want to update it for new function. The assembler ISFPARMS cannot be shared with any other release of SDSF. Only use ISFPARMS for the release on which it is assembled.</p> Note: If you have an SMP/E usermod that specifies modifications to assembler macro ISFPARMS, change the usermod to indicate that module ISFPARMS is now owned by the z/OS base V2R2 SDSF FMID (HQX77A0). The correct SMP/E syntax is ++VER(Z038) FMID(HQX77A0) 
									<p>Also, in the SMP/E usermod, change the distlib to reference DISTLIB(AISFSRC). The correct SMP/E syntax is ++VER(Z038) FMID(HQX77A0). Your ++SRC or ++SRCUPD statement must specify DISTLIB(AISFSRC).</p>

						<instructions>This portion of the Workflow will guide you to submit a job to run an IBM Health Check for z/OS associated with this migration action, 
							<strong>IBMSDSF,SDSF_ISFPARMS_IN_USE</strong>. 
							<p>This check will be activated if it is not already active. If the check is activated, it will be deactivated at the end of the job, so that it remains in the same state as it was found.</p>  
							<p>If the health check runs with no exception, this step will be marked "Complete" indicating that this migration action requires no more activity.</p>  
							<p>If the health check finds an exception, this step will be marked as "Failed". This tells you that further investigation (and possibly more work) is necessary to complete this migration action. If the step is marked "Failed", you should review the health check output (via any method you use to view health check output, such as SDSF) and correct any situation that you find appropriate. You can then re-run this Workflow step to submit the health check job again, until the health check no longer receives an exception and the step is marked "Complete".</p>

						<h5 id="wq2503">Steps to take</h5>  
						<p>Follow these steps:</p>  
						<ol> 
							<li> 
								<p>Identify any programs or jobs that issue RACF commands with the following conditions:</p>  
								<ul> 
									<li> 
										<strong>ADDUSER</strong>  
										<p>command that does not specify the PASSWORD keyword.</p> 
									</li>  
									<li> 
										<strong>ADDUSER</strong>  
										<p>and 
											<strong>ALTUSER</strong> commands that specify the PASSWORD keyword, but omit an explicit password value.
										</p> 
									</li>  
									<li> 
										<p>Programs that call the ADMN_RUN_COMD function of the R_admin SAF callable service (IRRSEQ00) on the 
											<strong>ADDUSER</strong>, 
											<strong>ALTUSER</strong>, or 
											<strong>PASSWORD</strong> commands, as described here.
										</p> 
									</li>  
									<li> 
										<p>Programs that call the ADMN_ADD_USER or ADMN_ALT_USER functions of the R_admin SAF callable service (IRRSEQ00) with input parameter lists that are functionally equivalent to the 
											<strong>ADDUSER</strong>, 
											<strong>ALTUSER</strong>, or 
											<strong>PASSWORD</strong> commands, as described here.
										</p> 
									</li> 
								</ul> 
							</li>  
							<li> 
								<p>Depending on the condition listed above, either remove the command, change it to one that specifies an explicit password value, or leave it as-is and tolerate the change of behavior, as appropriate.</p> 
							</li> 
						</ol> Example: Before z/OS V2R2, the following 
						<strong>ALTUSER</strong> command would reset the password for user BECKYH to the user’s default group name: ALTUSER BECKYH PASSWORD. In z/OS V2R2 with OA48667 applied, the PASSWORD operand is ignored. To reset a password, you must provide a temporary password explicitly: ALTUSER BECKYH PASSWORD(TEMP1234).

						<description><![CDATA[  
							<h5 id="wq2522">Description</h5>  
							<p>Starting in z/OS V2R2, RACF no longer uses the masking algorithm (a weak form of encryption) by default to authenticate passwords and password phrases when the initial attempt using DES results in failure. To continue the use of masking, which is not recommended, your installation can do so only by using an ICHDEX01 (password authentication) exit routine. If no ICHDEX01 exit routine exists, RACF now uses only DES encryption for authentication.</p>  
							<p>The Key Derivation Function with AES (KDFAES) algorithm is the preferred method for authenticating passwords and password phrases. If your installation does not use KDFAES encryption, RACF performs authentication by using the DES algorithm, unless you supply an ICHDEX01 exit routine. In the ICHDEX01 exit routine, your installation can provide an encryption algorithm, or instruct RACF to use one of the following forms of authentication:</p>  
							<dl> 
								<dt>Return code 4</dt>  
								<dd> 
									<p>Use the masking algorithm.</p> 
								</dd>  
								<dt>Return code 8</dt>  
								<dd> 
									<p>Use the DES algorithm.</p> 
								</dd>  
								<dt>Return code 16</dt>  
								<dd> 
									<p>Attempt to use DES first. If DES processing fails, use masking. This was the default behavior before z/OS V2R2 if no ICHDEX01 exit routine was installed.</p> 
								</dd> 
							</dl>  
							<p>When the KDFAES algorithm is active, masking is never used, thus no migration action is needed. RACF continues to call ICHDEX01 to evaluate a legacy password, but no longer honors masking. When a password is changed under KDFAES, the ICHDEX01 exit is no longer called for that password.</p>  
							<p>If your installation uses KDFAES encryption, it is recommended that you remove the ICHDEX01 exit routine, if it is no longer needed. For example, if the exit routine was used previously to always pass return code 8 (DES only), you can achieve the same result in z/OS V2R2 by removing the exit routine.</p>  
							<p>If your installation uses DES encryption, and you suspect there might be masked passwords in your RACF database, and you need to avoid any application outages that would result from the change in the default behavior, you must install an ICHDEX01 exit that sets return code 16. IBM recommends, however, that you attempt to identify such passwords and change them so that they are encrypted using DES.</p>

							<p>Check for the existence of the ICHDEX01 exit routine in your RACF configuration. If it is present, determine whether you still need it. If not, remove it.</p>  
							<p>Follow these steps:</p>  
							<ol> 
								<li> 
									<p>Check for the existence of the ICHDEX01 exit routine in your RACF configuration. During IPL, message ICH508I identifies the active exits. Check the message output for the presence of an ICHDEX01 exit routine. Or, run health check RACF_ENCRYPTION_ALGORITHM, which can detect return codes from an active ICHDEX01 exit routine.</p> 
								</li>  
								<li> 
									<p>If an ICHDEX01 exit routine is present, determine whether you still need it. Be aware that the masking algorithm provides weaker protection, as compared to KDFAES or DES.</p> 
								</li>  
								<li> 
									<p>Remove the exit routine if it is no longer needed. As an extra precaution, check for user profiles with old password change dates, which might indicate masked passwords. In these cases, you should either reset the password or delete it, rather than using the ICHDEX01 exit to preserve the usage of weak passwords. Use the RACF 
										<strong>LISTUSER</strong> command to determine when passwords were last updated.
									</p>  
									<p>Otherwise, if your installation uses DES encryption, and you suspect there might be masked passwords in your RACF database, and you need to avoid any application outages that would result from the change in the default behavior, you must install an ICHDEX01 exit routine that sets return code 16, which mimics the current default behavior. Here is an example of the exit code that you can use:</p>  
									<pre> 
<code>LA 15,16 BR 14</code>
									</pre> 
								</li> 
							</ol> Note: IBM recommends that you use KDFAES encryption, rather than DES encryption or masking. KDFAES provides improved cryptographic strength in RACF password algorithm processing, and helps to protect RACF password data if a copy of a RACF database becomes inadvertently accessible. KDFAES encryption was introduced by APAR OA43999 for z/OS V1R12, V1R13, and V2R1, which is deactivated by default.

							<strong>IBMRACF,RACF_ENCRYPTION_ALGORITHM</strong>. 
							<p>This check will be activated if it is not already active. If the check is activated, it will be deactivated at the end of the job, so that it remains in the same state as it was found.</p>  
							<p>If the health check runs with no exception, this step will be marked "Complete" indicating that this migration action requires no more activity.</p>  
							<p>If the health check finds an exception, this step will be marked as "Failed". This tells you that further investigation (and possibly more work) is necessary to complete this migration action. If the step is marked "Failed", you should review the health check output (via any method you use to view health check output, such as SDSF) and correct any situation that you find appropriate. You can then re-run this Workflow step to submit the health check job again, until the health check no longer receives an exception and the step is marked "Complete".</p>

						<p>To install the database template updates, run the IRRMIN00 utility with PARM=UPDATE.</p> Tip: The RACF database templates have been updated for z/OS V2R2. The templates contain a version string with a value of HRF77A0 00000194.00000022. Note: If IRRMIN00 produces a return code of 4 and message IRR8025 PARM=UPDATE specified, but template update not required, you do not necessarily have a problem. Check that your JCL points to the new level of IRRMIN00. If it does, ignore the return code and warning message. A PTF might have already brought your templates up to the current level for the new release. If your JCL accidentally points to an old copy of IRRMIN00, correct the JCL and run IRRMIN00 again.

						<description><![CDATA[  
							<h5 id="wq2616">Description</h5>  
							<p>Before z/OS V1R7, the HFS file system was the primary hierarchical file system. As of z/OS V1R7, you can use any combination of HFS and zFS file systems. Because zFS has higher performance characteristics than HFS and is the strategic file system, you should migrate your HFS file systems to zFS.</p>  
							<p>The HFS and zFS file system types in mount statements and command operands are now generic file system types that can mean either HFS or zFS. Based on the data set type, the system will determine which is appropriate. But note that you must still specify a type (HFS or zFS and it cannot be defaulted), and if the type you specify is not correct for the file system being mounted, any associated parameter string setting in the mount statement or command is ignored, even though the system sets the type correctly and processes the mount.</p>

											<p>Ensure that the PTF for APAR OA46639 is installed on your system. This APAR corrects a problem that can occur when socket type files are copied.</p> 
										</li>  
										<li> 
											<p>Establish backout procedures.</p> 
										</li>  
										<li> 
											<p>Decide on naming conventions.</p> 
										</li>  
										<li> 
											<p>Decide on unavailability.</p> 
										</li>  
										<li> 
											<p>Understand any cloning or deployment changes required by zFS systems being linear data sets. Considerations would include any copy utility invocations, BPXPRMxx specifications for symbolics, and placement of zFS file systems on system volumes.</p> 
										</li> 
									</ul> 
								</li>  
								<li> 
									<p>Perform the conversion from an HFS to zFS file system.</p>  
									<p>You can use the BPXWH2Z tool to perform the conversion. It is an ISPF-based tool that migrates HFS file systems to zFS file systems. Using its panel interface, you can alter the space allocation, placement, SMS classes, and data set names. A HELP panel is provided. With this tool, you can:</p>  
									<ul> 
										<li> 
											<p>Migrate HFS file systems (both mounted and unmounted) to zFS file systems. If the HFS being migrated is mounted, the tool automatically unmounts it and then mounts the new zFS file system on its current mount point.</p> 
										</li>  
										<li> 
											<p>Define zFS aggregates by default to be approximately the same size as the HFS. The new allocation size can also be increased or decreased. In z/OS V1R13, ZFS could require up to four times (4X) the space that HFS did; therefore, for z/OS V2R1 be sure to allocate more space. See zFS: Accommodate new DASD space requirements.</p> 
										</li>  
										<li> 
											<p>Have the migration run in TSO/E foreground or UNIX background.</p> 
										</li> 
									</ul>  
									<p>You can use the JCL sample ISPBTCH in SYS1.SAMPLIB to invoke BPXWH2Z as an ISPF batch job. Before you run the job, read the Notes section. When you run BPXWH2Z on your z/OS system, make sure it uses that same z/OS level of the pax command. You can manually migrate from an HFS to zFS file system without using the tool. However, you would need to allocate and format the target zFS file systems.</p>  
									<p>You can use the JCL sample ISPBTCH in SYS1.SAMPLIB to invoke BPXWH2Z as an ISPF batch job. Before you run the job, read the notes section. When you run BPXWH2Z on your z/OS V1R13 system, it uses the z/OS V1R13 level of the 
										<strong>pax</strong> command. This level was enhanced in z/OS V1R7 for sparse file support and other characteristics that are of concern when migrating from an HFS to zFS file system. You can manually migrate from an HFS to zFS file system without using the tool. However, you would need to allocate and format the target zFS file systems.
									</p>  
									<p> 
										<strong>Requirement</strong>: The BPXWH2Z tool requires the zFS address space to be operational. Therefore, before attempting to migrate existing HFS to zFS file systems using BPXWH2Z, make sure that the zFS address space has been successfully configured and initialized.
									</p> Tip: You can dynamically migrate the HFS sysplex root in a shared file system configuration to zFS while the root is in use, without disrupting workloads. Although the shared file system configuration is required, the sysplex can be a single system. For the steps involved in migrating the sysplex root file system from HFS to zFS, see "Migrating the sysplex root file system from HFS to zFS after IPLing z/OS V1R12".
								</li>  
								<li> 
									<p>Change policies and scripts, and so forth, to reflect the change from the HFS file system to zFS file system. Use the RMF Monitor III option to report on zFS activity. Refer to migration action "Monitor the zFS file system activity" for information on gathering zFS activity in RMF Monitor III.</p> Tip: Use the RMF Monitor III option to report on zFS activity.
								</li>  
								<li> 
									<p>The DDNAME(name) keyword of the BPXPRMxx ROOT and MOUNT statements is not supported by zFS. If you use them. change these statements to use the FILESYSTEM( 
										<em>name</em>) keyword instead.
									</p> 
								</li> 
							</ol>  
							<p>Migrating the sysplex root file system from HFS to zFS after IPLing your previous z/OS system:</p>  
							<p>Before you begin the migration:</p>  
							<ul> 
								<li> 
									<p>Ensure that the following requirements have been met:</p>  
									<ul> 
										<li> 
											<p>All systems in the sysplex are at the V1R12 level.</p> 
										</li>  
										<li> 
											<p>The current sysplex root file system PFS, and the new sysplex root file system PFS, are up in all the systems in shared file system configuration.</p> 
										</li> 
									</ul> 
								</li>  
								<li> 
									<p>Be aware of the following restrictions:</p>  
									<ul> 
										<li> 
											<p>The current sysplex root file system must be mounted as a read-only file system.</p> 
										</li>  
										<li> 
											<p>The systems that do not meet the requirements for this migration action cannot join the sysplex during the sysplex root file system migration processing, but they can join the sysplex after the sysplex root migration has completed.</p> 
										</li>  
										<li> 
											<p>The current sysplex root and the new sysplex root must be either HFS or zFS in any combination. If the new sysplex root is zFS, then it must be HFS-compatible.</p> 
										</li>  
										<li> 
											<p>The sysplex root or any directories on it cannot have been exported by the DFS or SMB server.</p> 
										</li> 
									</ul> 
								</li>  
								<li> 
									<p>Note the following:</p>  
									<ul> 
										<li> 
											<p>Remote NFS mounts of the sysplex root or any directories on it are considered active use of the current sysplex root file system.</p> 
										</li>  
										<li> 
											<p>During the migration, the new zFS sysplex root file system must not be HSM-migrated, mounted, or in use.</p> 
										</li>  
										<li> 
											<p>Mount parameters are preserved during the migration or replacement of the sysplex root file system of the same file system type (PFS). They are dropped if the file system type is different.</p> 
										</li>  
										<li> 
											<p>Directories, data, files, and links are not copied from one file system to another.</p> 
										</li> 
									</ul> 
								</li> 
							</ul>  
							<p>Perform the migration as follows:</p>  
							<ol> 
								<li> 
									<p>Ensure that a file system has been mounted read-only as the current sysplex root file system. When the root is mounted read-only, there are no function-shipping clients as long as physical paths to the DASD are available to each system. To verify that there are no function-shipping clients, issue:</p>  
									<pre> 
<code>D OMVS,F,NAME=root_file_system_name</code>
									</pre>  
									<p>You should see CLIENT=N on each system.</p> 
								</li>  
								<li> 
									<p>Allocate and set up the new zFS sysplex root file system:</p>  
									<ol> 
										<li> 
											<p>Create a new zFS file system to be used as the new sysplex root file system. 
												<cite>z/OS Distributed File Service zFS Administration</cite> discusses creating and managing zFS file systems.
											</p>  
											<p> 
												<strong>Rules</strong>:
											</p>  
											<ul> 
												<li> 
													<p>The UID, GID and the permission bits of the root directory in the new sysplex root file system must be same as the root directory in the current sysplex root file system.</p> 
												</li>  
												<li> 
													<p>If the SECLABEL class is active and the MLFSOBJ option is active, the security label for the new zFS file system must match the assumed security label of the current sysplex root file system.</p> 
												</li> 
											</ul> 
										</li>  
										<li> 
											<p>On the new sysplex root file system, set up the active mount points and the symbolic links. The mount points and symbolic links must be the same as the ones on the current sysplex root file system. You can set them up either (1) manually or (2) by using the pax shell command to populate the new sysplex root file system using the existing sysplex root as a source. To do it manually, create a mount point in the existing sysplex root (for example, /newroot) and mount the new sysplex root file system in the MODE(RDWR) on that mount point. After mounting the new sysplex root file system, manually issue MKDIRs and ln -s to create the mount point directories and symbolic links similar to the existing sysplex root file system. Note that the new sysplex root file system must contain all active mount points and symbolic links exactly as on the existing sysplex root file system.</p> 
										</li>  
										<li> 
											<p>Use the pax shell command to populate the new file system, using the existing sysplex root as a source.</p>  
											<p> 
												<strong>Example</strong>:
											</p>  
											<pre> 
<code>cd / pax -wr -pe -XCM ./ /newroot</code>
											</pre>  
											<p>For more information about using pax to copy data from an HFS file system to a zFS file system, see 
												<cite>z/OS Distributed File Service zFS Administration</cite>.
											</p> 
										</li>  
										<li> 
											<p>Unmount the new zFS file system.</p> 
										</li> 
									</ol> 
								</li>  
								<li> 
									<p>On any system in the shared file system configuration, issue:</p>  
									<pre> 
<code>F OMVS,NEWROOT=new.root.file.system.name,COND=&lt;YesNo&gt;</code>
									</pre>  
									<dl> 
										<dt>YES</dt>  
										<dd> 
											<p>Proceed conditionally. The system checks for active usage in the current sysplex root file system and reports the active usage in a BPXF245I message. If file activity is found, the command fails with EBUSY return code and JrActivityFound reason code. If file activity is not found, the command continues processing to replace the sysplex root. YES is the default.</p> 
										</dd>  
										<dt>NO</dt>  
										<dd> 
											<p>Proceed unconditionally. The system checks for active usage in the current sysplex root file system and reports the active usage in a BPXF245I message. Replacement of the sysplex root file system will continue.</p> 
										</dd> 
									</dl>  
									<p>The migration of the sysplex root file system will begin. During the migration, active connections to files and directories in the current sysplex root file system are broken.</p>  
									<p>After the migration completes:</p>  
									<ul> 
										<li> 
											<p>The root CWD(‘/’) is updated on all systems in the sysplex to point to the new sysplex root file system.</p> 
										</li>  
										<li> 
											<p>New opens go to the new sysplex root file system. The current sysplex root for the root directory is replaced for all processes in all systems. The current directory for root directory is replaced for any processes using it</p> 
										</li>  
										<li> 
											<p>Old connections in the previous sysplex root file system might get EIO errors.</p> 
										</li> 
									</ul> 
								</li>  
								<li> 
									<p>Update the TYPE parameter and name of the sysplex root file system in the BPXPRM xx member of SYS1.PARMLIB. Because the DDNAME() keyword of the BPXPRMxx ROOT and CMOUNT statements is not supported by zFS, change these statements to use the FILESYSTEM( 
										<em>name</em>) keyword instead.

						<h5 id="wq2635">Description</h5>  
						<p>Before z/OS V2R2 and without the PTFs for APAR OA45793 installed, the sticky attribute was honored when either the set-user-id or set-group-id attributes were set. Starting with z/OS V2R2, APAR OA45793 changes the behavior of the exec (BPX1EXC or BPX4EXC) and spawn (BPX1SPN or BPX4SPN) interfaces when the user-specified path name resolves to a file that has the sticky attribute and either the set-user-id or set-group-id attributes. The exec and spawn services now ignore the sticky attribute unless a new RACF FACILITY class profile indicates that the usage is acceptable. Ignoring the sticky attribute means that the MVS program search order will not be used to locate the target program; only the z/OS UNIX program file that is identified by the user-specified path name is used.</p>  
						<p>EC6 abends with reason code xxxxE055 occur if the program is found in the MVS program search and no matching FACILITY class profile is found. If the program is not found in the MVS program search order, the z/OS UNIX file is run, which is the current behavior of exec and spawn.</p>

						<p>Follow these steps:</p>  
						<ol> 
							<li> 
								<p>Remove the /var/man directory and all subdirectories and files on your z/OS V2R2 system. These files are no longer used for the z/OS V2R2 
									<strong>man</strong> command.
								</p> 
							</li>  
							<li> 
								<p>The z/OS V2R2 
									<strong>man</strong> command uses the temporary directory for caching man pages. Each user has their own man page cache in the temporary directory. This change might increase the size of the temporary directory, depending on how much man command usage there is on your system. Monitor space usage for the temporary directory to ensure that there is adequate space for users to issue the 
									<strong>man</strong> command. The temporary directory can be the directory referred to by the TMPDIR environment variable, or 
									<strong>/tmp</strong> if TMPDIR is not defined.
