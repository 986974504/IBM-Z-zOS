IBM z/OS z15 Workflow
=====================

**Helping you to prepare for the IBM z15 server!**

Did you know that you can use a z/OSMF workflow to prepare your z/OS system for upgrading to the IBM z15&trade; server?  
This workflow contains interactive steps for upgrade considerations, restrictions, and actions to take before you order your server, 
along with a checklist of items that will be discontinued on future servers. 

The z/OS V2R4 Upgrade Workflow step *"Upgrade to an IBM z15 server."* will contain the same valuable information.  If you only want to see the z15 hardware upgrade upgrade actions in its own workflow, this is the one to use.  Otherwise, use the z/OS V2R4
Upgrade Workflow to see both the hardware and z/OS software upgrade actions in a combined workflow.

You can provide feedback to IBM for any of the steps in the workflow, if you wish.

**What's new**

The IBM z/OS z15 Workflow is updated with new information for the IBM z15 (type 8561). The z15 is the newest addition to the 
IBM Z server family.

In the workflow, references to "z15" pertain to all models of the IBM z15, unless otherwise noted.

**Important information**

Transfer the appropriate two files as binary using File Transfer Protocol (FTP), and store them in the same z/OS UNIX directory:

    * z15_zOS_Upgrade_Workflow.xml
    * HC_rexx.txt
 
We welcome any contributions or feedback on anything you find. Keep in mind, there are no warranties for any of the files or contributions
that you find here. This is a z/OS community that is sharing with others and it is expected that you review what you are using in your
environment. This tool is not supported by the IBM Service organization, but rather by the tool owner on a best-can-do basis.

Please report any problems, suggestions, or comments to zosmig@us.ibm.com.
