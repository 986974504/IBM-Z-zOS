This workflow provides step-by-step instructions for setting up transparent cloud tiering, which was introduced in z/OS V2R1 DFSMS. Transparent cloud tiering allows data storage on a cloud, in combination with support provided by the IBM System Storage DS8000. The following DFSMS cloud storage functions are included: cloud connection definition using ISMF and SMS, command-based migration and recall using DFSMShsm, DFSMShsm audit support, and command-based backup and recovery to a cloud using DFSMSdss.
