using the <b>Assignment and Ownership</b> action in the Workflow Steps table. 
Taking ownership is important, because without it you will not see the <b>Perform</b> tab, which contains the meat of the instructions for each step, 
instructions you'll need to complete the workflow task.. <p>If you're the owner of the workflow, you can take ownership of all steps. 
If you were assigned some or all steps by the owner, you can take ownership of those steps.</p><p>Do the following:
<ul><li>From the table listing the steps for the workflow (the Workflow Steps table), select the step or steps to be owned by you. This action is disabled if the step is not assigned to you. </li>
<li>Click <b>Actions</b>, then select <b>Assignment and Ownership</b> --> <b>Take Ownership</b>. The Take Ownership window is displayed. This page includes the Selected Steps table. 
You can expand this section to review the steps for which this action applies. </li>
<li>Optionally, enter a comment in the Comments field to document this action. </li>
<li>Click OK to complete the transfer of step ownership to yourself. </li>
<li><b>Did these instructions work?</b> To verify that these instructions worked, check to see if the <b>Perform</b> tab is not grayed out, and that when you click on it, you see 
information in the <b>Perform</b> tab. </li></ul>
</p></li><li><b>Expand all steps for ease of navigation:</b> You might find it easier to navigate through all the steps in the workflow if you expand the view so that all the sub-steps show as follows:
<ol>
<li>Click <b>Actions</b>, then select <b>Select All</b>.</li>
<li>Click <b>Actions</b>, then select <b>Expand</b>.</li></ol></li>
<li><b>Track your progress:</b> When you have performed the work of a step, click the <b>Finish</b> box below the instructions to track your progress through the workflow. 
This also takes you back out to the list of steps for the workflow so that you are ready to go on to the next one.
</li><li><b>Navigate substeps:</b> To navigate to the substeps contained within a step, click on the workflow title of the workflow at the top of the screen. 
Although the sub-steps are listed below the step, you cannot navigate to the sub-steps from within a step.<p>Note that a step containing substeps does not include a <b>Perform</b> tab.</p></li></ul></description><instructions>Congratulations!

from all systems in the sysplex; path
numbers may be different for each system. Taking the
paths offline and then recycling is cleaner for z/OS to
handle than not taking the paths offline. The hot
unplug or TOGGLE is received as an “error” by z/OS.</p><p>To obtain the list of CHPIDs, issue <code>D CF</code> from each
system. The list of CHPIDs is helpful when bringing the
paths back online.</p><p>The VARY command is used rather than the CONFIG
command because it is possible that use of the links by
STP would cause the CONFIG command to be rejected.
Using the VARY command affects only the logical path
state for coupling facility communication and does not
affect (nor is it affected by) the STP network; STP can
still utilize the links to maintain the timing network.</p><p>When the paths are VARYd OFFLINE, the <code>D CF,CFNAME=<i>cfname</i></code> command shows the paths as being
logically offline, but physically online.</p></li><li>At this point, the paths to the CF will indicate logically OFFLINE.

have connectivity to CF using the following commands: <p><code>RO *ALL,D CF,CFNAME=<i>cfname</i></code> </p><p>Verify that no structures remain on the coupling facility about to be upgraded:</p><p><code>D XCF,CF,CFNAME=<i>cfname</i></code></p></li></ol></instructions><weight>1</weight></step><!--<step name="Step11">	<title>Verify that no system has an active path to CF</title><description>Verify that no system has an active path to CF.</description>	<instructions/><weight>1</weight></step>--><step name="Step10">	<title>Shut down the CF</title><description>Shut down the CF.  <p>See the <b>Perform</b> workflow tab for further instructions.</p></description><instructions>From the Operating System Messages panel for the Coupling Facility on the Hardware Management Console (HMC), issue the SHUTDOWN command.<!--From the CF OPERMSG console, issue the <code>SHUTDOWN</code> command. --> The <code>SHUTDOWN</code> command is recommended to avoid the potential error of DEACTIVATING the coupling
facility that has all of the structures allocated in it. The
<code>SHUTDOWN</code> command will not complete if structures
are present in the coupling facility.
<p>The following scenario shows the message sequence for
the SHUTDOWN command when structures are still
allocated in the CF:</p>
<code>=> shutdown
CF0090A Do you really want to shut down
the Coupling Facility? (YES/NO)
=> yes
CF0093A There are structures present in
the CF. SHUTDOWN canceled.</code>
<p>After the <code>SHUTDOWN</code> command completes successfully, the CF LPAR will become “not operating.”</p><p>If structures are still allocated in the CF, verify that the correct CF was selected for <code>SHUTDOWN</code>. If the correct
CF was selected, consider reviewing the structures still allocated in the CF and seek to move them out of the CF.
At this point, the paths must be VARYd back ONLINE to allow structures to rebuild out of the CF. VARY the paths
ONLINE and go back to Step 7, "Manually rebuild any structures that remain in the CF". 
If VARYing the paths ONLINE and moving the structures is not desired (that
is, deleting the structures has been deemed acceptable), the CF image may be DEACTIVATEd.
