<p>IBM® Open Data Analytics for z/OS® offers an integrated, optimized runtime foundation of industry-leading open
source technologies that can be used to gain analytic insights at the source of data origin, by leveraging Apache Spark as
well as Anaconda and Python environments.
<p>The following workflows provide step-by-step instructions for installing, configuring, and tuning IBM Open Data Analytics for z/OS. The workflows are:
<dl>
<dt>workflow_izodaic.xml</dt>
<dd>Installation and configuration.
<dt>workflow_izodatune.xml</dt>
<dd>Tuning and allocating resources.
</dl>
<p>A new, dynamic workflow is available for z/OS Spark 2.2. This new workflow is delivered as part of IBM Open Data Analytics for z/OS in APAR PH01619 (SPARK 2.2.0.6).  However, the dynamic workflow does not support z/OS Spark 2.1. See the IBM Open Data Analytics for z/OS Installation and Customization Guide (https://www.ibm.com/servers/resourcelink/svc00100.nsf/pages/izodav110sc279033/$file/azk1a100.pdf) for details.</p>
<p>We suggest that you use workflow_izodaic.xml included here for Spark 2.1 releases and the dynamic workflow included in the IzODA product for Spark 2.2 releases.</p>
