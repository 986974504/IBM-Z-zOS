z/OSMF workflows for the z/OS platform
======================================

This repository contains workflow definitions (XML files) that can be used with the Workflows task of the z/OS Management Facility (z/OSMF).

In z/OSMF, a **workflow** is a guided set of steps that help you perform an activity on z/OS®, such as configuring a software product, managing a z/OS resource, or simplifying some relatively complex operation. To support these activities, a workflow can be designed to perform a wide variety of operations, such as starting z/OS subsystems, submitting jobs and scripts, and invoking TSO/E functions.

This repository contains an IBM® folder and a community folder. The IBM folder contains workflows that were developed and tested at IBM. The community folder contains workflows that were contributed by members of the z/OS community.

The following workflows are available for download: 

* [z/OS V2.3 Migration Workflow](zOS%20V2.3%20Migration%20Workflow)

* [z/OS z14 Workflow](zOS%20z14%20Workflow)
